This consumes lots of energy and creates severe environmental pollution. For the sustainable development of manufacturing, it is necessary to scientifically evaluate the manufacturing energy efficiency of Yangtze River Basin. In this paper, the suitable metrics are firstly selected to evaluate the manufacturing energy efficiency (MEE) under environmental constraints. Then, the panel data 2010–2018 on the manufacturing of the 11 regions of the Yangtze River Basin were taken as the object. On this basis, the MEE in the Belt was analyzed statically and dynamically with the slack-based measure (SBM) model and Malmquist-Luenberger metric, respectively. In addition, the Tobit model was adopted for regression analysis on how various factors affect the Belt MEE. The results show that: the MEEs in the Belt were severe polarized, with significant differences between regions; in most regions, the ML was improved to varied degrees in the sample interval; comparatively, technological progress boasts stronger promoting effect than technical efficiency improvement; the Belt MEE is significantly promoted by technological innovation, foreign trade, and environmental regulation, significantly suppressed by property-right structure and energy price, and not significantly affected by industrial structure or energy structure. © 2021 THE AUTHORS","Malmquist-Luenberger (ML) metric; Manufacturing energy efficiency (MEE); Yangtze River Basin",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107694121

Most previous studies that consider this question focus on a single country or compare countries’ guidelines without controlling for differences in country-level consumption patterns. To address this gap, we model the carbon footprint of the dietary guidelines from seven different countries, examine the key contributors to this, and control for consumption differences between countries. Methods: In this purposive sample, we obtained FBDG from national sources for Germany, India, the Netherlands, Oman, Thailand, Uruguay, and the United States. These were used to structure recommended diets using 6 food groups: protein foods, dairy, grains, fruits, vegetables, and oils/fats. To determine specific quantities of individual foods within these groups, we used data on food supplies available for human consumption for each country from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s food balance sheets. The greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) used to produce the foods in these consumption patterns were linked from our own database, constructed from an exhaustive review of the life cycle assessment literature. All guidelines were scaled to a 2000-kcal diet. Results: Daily recommended amounts of dairy foods ranged from a low of 118 ml/d for Oman to a high of 710 ml/d for the US. The GHGE associated with these two recommendations were 0.17 and 1.10 kg CO2-eq/d, respectively. The GHGE associated with the protein food recommendations ranged from 0.03 kg CO2-eq/d in India to 1.84 kg CO2-eq/d in the US, for recommended amounts of 75 g/d and 156 g/d, respectively. Overall, US recommendations had the highest carbon footprint at 3.83 kg CO2-eq/d, 4.5 times that of the recommended diet for India, which had the smallest footprint. After controlling for country-level consumption patterns by applying the US consumption pattern to all countries, US recommendations were still the highest, 19% and 47% higher than those of the Netherlands and Germany, respectively. Conclusions: Despite our common human biology, FBDG vary tremendously from one country to the next, as do the associated carbon footprints of these guidelines. Understanding the carbon footprints of different recommendations can assist in future decision-making to incorporate environmental sustainability in dietary guidance. © 2021, The Author(s).","Carbon footprint; dataFIELD; FAO food balance sheet; Food-based dietary guidelines; Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101843758

Moreover, by generating an optimal disassembly sequence, the time to dismantle the product will be reduced, and in turn, cost also reduces. However, achieving an optimal disassembly sequence is not an easy task as it is an NP-hard combinatorial problem. Many researchers followed different approaches like mathematical, knowledge-based and artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to generate optimal disassembly sequences. Most of the researchers concentrate on generating the optimal disassembly sequence, but only a few of them discuss the disposal of the parts after EOL. It is very much essential to consider the type of disposal that has to follow the individual components after dismantle to reduce the effect on the environment due to parts of the EOL product. In this research work, a stability graph cut-set method is applied to generate optimal disassembly sequences by considering the minimum number of directional changes as a fitness equation. In the proposed methodology, a stability graph is formulated for the considered assembly to apply cut-set rules for generating optimal assembly sequences. Later, the reverse of the obtained optimal assembly sequences is followed to generate the optimal disassembly sequences. In this strategy, along with the generation of optimal disassembly sequences, the type of disposal (like landfill, incineration and recycling) that has to follow for the individual parts is also discussed using a SOLIDWORKS sustainable tool. The proposed stability graph cut-set method is validated using an eleven-part punching machine assembly to generate the optimal disassembly sequences; also the type of disposal that has to follow for each part after dismantle is discussed. Moreover, the proposed methodology is compared to the well-known algorithms [genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm] in terms of the number of iterations, the number of optimal disassembly sequences generated and fitness value to check the performance of the algorithm. © 2021, Indian Academy of Sciences.","cut-set method; disassembly; punching machine; stability graph; Sustainability tool","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Incineration; Knowledge based systems; NP-hard; Stability; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Assembly sequence; Combinatorial problem; Directional changes; Disassembly sequence; End-of-life products; Individual components; Number of iterations; Graphic methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100432987

The approach of traditional healthcare systems to disaster preparedness and prevention has demonstrated intrinsic problems, such as failure to detect early the spread of the virus, public hospitals being overwhelmed, a dire shortage of personal protective equipment, and exhaustion of healthcare workers. Consequently, this situation resulted in manpower and resource costs, leading to the widespread and exponential rise of infected cases at the early stage of the epidemic. To limit the spread of infection, the Chinese government adopted innovative, specialized, and advanced systems, including empowered Fangcang and Internet hospitals, as well as high technologies such as 5G, big data analysis, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The efficient use of these new forces helped China win its fight against the virus. As the rampant spread of the virus continues outside China, these new forces need to be integrated into the global healthcare system to combat the disease. Global healthcare system integrated with new forces is essential not only for COVID-19 but also for unknown infections in the future. © 2021, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Epidemic: healthcare system; High-tech; Internet hospitals: post-epidemic era","COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; health care; health worker; hospital sector; infectious disease; Internet; public health; sustainability; China; community hospital; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic error; disaster preparedness; disaster response; epidemic; exposure; government; health care access; health care availability; health care cost; health care need; health care system; health personnel attitude; hospital; human; infection prevention; medical resource shortage; mortality; personnel shortage; priority journal; public reporting (health care); Review; technology; virus transmission; work environment; artificial intelligence; disaster planning; epidemic; epidemiology; health care personnel; organization and management; prevention and control; China; Artificial Intelligence; China; COVID-19; Disaster Planning; Disease Outbreaks; Government; Health Personnel; Humans",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099935987

Spatial video (SV) has proven to be a useful tool to collect environmental and social data at a granular scale, though the effort required to turn these spatially encoded video frames into maps limits sustainability and scalability. In this paper we explore the use of convolution neural networks (CNN) to solve this problem by automatically identifying disease related environmental risks in a series of SV collected from Haiti. Our objective is to determine the potential of machine learning in health risk mapping for these environments by assessing the challenges faced in adequately training the required classification models. Results: We show that SV can be a suitable source for automatically identifying and extracting health risk features using machine learning. While well-defined objects such as drains, buckets, tires and animals can be efficiently classified, more amorphous masses such as trash or standing water are difficult to classify. Our results further show that variations in the number of image frames selected, the image resolution, and combinations of these can be used to improve the overall model performance. Conclusion: Machine learning in combination with spatial video can be used to automatically identify environmental risks associated with common health problems in informal settlements, though there are likely to be variations in the type of data needed for training based on location. Success based on the risk type being identified are also likely to vary geographically.

The first-line recommended treatment for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI). CBTI is typically delivered in-person or online over one-to-four sessions (brief versions) or five-to-eight sessions (standard versions) by a licensed doctoral or masters-level clinician with extensive training in behavioral sleep medicine. Despite its effectiveness, CBTI has limited scalability. Three main factors inhibit access to and delivery of CBTI including restricted availability of clinical expertise; rigid, resource-intensive treatment formats; and limited capacities for just-in-time monitoring and treatment personalization. Digital technologies offer a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges by providing scalable, personalized, resource-sensitive, adaptive, and cost-effective approaches for evidence-based insomnia treatment. Methods: This is a hybrid type 3 implementation-effectiveness randomized trial using a scalable evidence-based digital health software platform, NOCTEM™’s Clinician-Operated Assistive Sleep Technology (COAST™). COAST includes a clinician portal and a patient app, and it utilizes algorithms that facilitate detection of sleep disordered patterns, support clinical decision-making, and personalize sleep interventions. The first aim is to compare three clinician- and system-centered implementation strategies on the reach, adoption, and sustainability of the COAST digital platform by offering (1) COAST only, (2) COAST plus external facilitation (EF: assistance and consultation to providers by NOCTEM’s sleep experts), or (3) COAST plus EF and internal facilitation (EF/IF: assistance/consultation to providers by NOCTEM’s sleep experts and local champions). The second aim is to quantify improvements in insomnia among patients who receive behavioral sleep care via the COAST platform. We hypothesize that reach, adoption, and sustainability and the magnitude of improvements in insomnia will be superior in the EF and EF/IF groups relative to the COAST-only group. Discussion: Digital health technologies and machine learning-assisted clinical decision support tools have substantial potential for scaling access to insomnia treatment. This can augment the scalability and cost-effectiveness of CBTI without compromising patient outcomes. Engaging providers, stakeholders, patients, and decision-makers is key in identifying strategies to support the deployment of digital health technologies that can promote quality care and result in clinically meaningful sleep improvements, positive systemic change, and enhanced readiness and health among service members.

Unfortunately, traffic congestion has become a critical problem in urban cities. Road traffic congestion reduces productivity in transportation services, and the daily profit earned is consequently reduced. This is opposite to the cost of living, which is increasing rapidly. Therefore, these issues are causing difficulties in all occupations in terms of managing daily expenses, particularly for taxi drivers. The taxi driving is classified as low income compared to other occupations. Such facts are a symbol of economic inefficiency. To this end, this study aims to assist taxi agencies and the government in improving taxi driver profits in Bangkok using large-scale data. To deal with these large-scale data, we propose a big data-driven model. With this model, we first calculate costs using a cost–distance algorithm and trip reconstruction. The data are then modeled to understand distance-based profits with respect to the departure time and traffic conditions. Finally, several cost predictive models using machine learning are evaluated using the ground truth from 50 taxis for a 1-month period. The experiment results show that more frequent trips over a short distance yield higher profits than long-distance trips. Finally, a solution to improve taxi driver profits is determined. We also compare the advantages and disadvantages of a unified solution. © 2021, The Author(s).","Big data; Driving behavior; Global positioning system; Profit assessment; Spatial–temporal analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098862202

The pipeline is applied to an extensive collection of well-established validation cases for bubbly flows and allows the fast and efficient production of large amounts of results that are summarized in well-structured reports. An optional post-processing step introduces a fuzzy logic controller developed for the detailed analysis of these results by quantifying the agreement of the simulation with the available experimental data. It is demonstrated how such quantification enables the systematic evaluation of new closure models and contributes to a more sustainable model development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Baseline; Bubbly flow; OpenFOAM; Workflow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107695210

With the assistance of scanning electron microscope images, effects of alkali, lysozyme, papain, ultrasound, and their combinations on MSGB were evaluated using the results of soluble protein, carbohydrate, monosaccharides and peptidoglycans. Alkali could dissolve flocculated polymers increasing 21% soluble MSGB, and thus enhanced the subsequent treatments (ultrasound, lysozyme, or papain) to increase 14–17% soluble MSGB. As ultrasound mainly released intercellular components (mannose, and glucose) while lysozyme or papain mainly released cell wall components (peptidoglycans), the combination of alkali, ultrasound, and enzymes led to a highest soluble MSGB (78%), yielding a maximal B. subtilis production of 6.6 × 109 colony-forming units mL−1. This yield was about 33 times that of using untreated MSGB, and the key to improve B. subtilis production was the release of carbohydrate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cell wall degradation; Fermentation byproduct; Flocculated polymers; Intercellular components; Probiotics; Sustainable production","Bacilli; Bacteriology; Glucose; Scanning electron microscopy; Sustainable development; Ultrasonics; B.subtilis; Bacillus Subtilis; Cell wall degradation; Fermentation byproducts; Flocculated polymer; Intercellular component; Monosodium glutamate; Peptidoglycans; Probiotics; Sustainable production; Probiotics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105513962

First, the design of sustainable architectures –centered on adaptation, throughout a System-Development Life-Cycle (SDLC)– to develop robust and economically profitable products. Second, the use of self-adaptive techniques to adjust CPSs to the evolving circumstances of their operation context. This work presents a systematic mapping study (SMS) that discusses different approaches used to develop self-adaptive CPSs (SA-CPSs) at each stage of the SDLC, focused on sustainability.

It reforms the current diverse and high discrepancy levels of HW residual for EU-countries and Ukraine. Adopting a k-means clustering method with a multi-criteria taxonomic development level index (TIDL), it produces uniform clusters with higher accuracy and manageability. Findings discover and remedy opaque managerial practices, enabling sustainable and environment-friendly development at national and regional levels for EU-countries.

In this study, we developed a novel combined tandem type permeable reactive barriers-like (PRBs-like) technology with implanted targeted adsorbents to achieve the selective removal of metals from mining wastewater. In the continuous flow test, the PRBs-like enable the content of lead, arsenate and zinc ions in 790 mL of actual mine effluent to reach below the Chinese pollutant discharge standards for lead and zinc industries (GB2546-2010) within 6 h. The expected ability of the reactor benefits from the outstanding mass transfer of the three adsorbents, tannic acid based polymer (TABP), cerium oxide (CeO2) and zero-valent iron (ZVI), with capacities of 116.6, 87.5 and 61.8 mg g−1 for lead, arsenic and zinc ions at an equilibration time of 20 min. Noteworthy, TABP features a strong affinity for lead, as well as CeO2 for arsenate, which is favorable to the aggregation of a single species metal in the corresponding reaction partition. In addition, factors including different flow rates, pH and reaction media distances on the performance of PRBs-like were investigated, demonstrating excellent adaptability of the tandem reactor to the wastewater environment. And long-term experiments showed the high stability and efficiency of the operation of the reactor. The graded combined device and the targeted adsorbent were first integrated in this work to point out a high-efficiency pathway, which can recycle the heavy metals in mine wastewater. © 2021","Heavy metals; Mine wastewater; PRBs-like; Resourceful treatment; Targeted functional materials",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107130901

Esthetic features are amongst the main driving forces behind the marketability of buildings, thus improvement of sustainable buildings in terms of visual esthetics would enhance their marketability and thus their market intake. Nonetheless, esthetic improvement of the buildings is a challenging task because it lacks in scales and methods to measure and evaluate buildings' facade esthetic. In this regard, this study aims to develop machine learning-based models to predict the esthetic appreciation of buildings related to their façade features. For this purpose, an artificial neural network and decision tree models are developed and validated with the results of a conducted comprehensive survey (n = 807). In addition, the impact of different window features (i.e., position, number, area, width, height, symmetry, and proportion) on housings esthetic and marketability is investigated.

Social-media networks facilitate the dissemination of emergency information, which has been investigated as a useful tool to derive and analyze damage information. Here we develop a framework for rapid damage classification and recovery monitoring for urban floods that makes use of social-media big data (specifically, Weibo) by using an example that happened in Chongqing, China, from 18 to 20 August 2020. We first investigated the damage categories, including physical damage and emotional damage based on machine-learning classification algorithms. Then, we adopted a statistical model to measure the influencing factors of emotional responses to victims. Finally, we examined the ability of recovery based on keyword frequency representing flood destructive scenarios. We find that social-media data can be used to measure the level of damage and the state of the recovery. In the case we studied, regions with more physical damage tended to express more negative emotions, and government employees tended to convey positive information to reduce public panic when disaster occurs, while students were more likely to express negative emotions. The framework presented in this article provides a feasible way to obtain on-site damage information prior to conducting comprehensive surveys in disaster-stricken areas, which is helpful for real-time managing strategies for regional flood mitigation, as well managing as the sustainable development of flood-prone areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emotional damage; Floods; Physical damage; Recovery; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107757780

An effective solution to this problem is Demand Response (DR). Electric Water Heaters (EWHs) are considered ideal candidates for DR due to their energy storage capability. Due to the benefits, control strategies or techniques for EWHs have received considerable academic attention. The energy sector has recently tapped into the disruptive artificial intelligence world to learn, among other related priorities, how to enhance operations, maintain energy resilience and improve consumer service. Consequently, this paper reviews the use of machine learning (ML) for optimization and scheduling of EWHs. The main contributions of this review paper are, firstly, to identify state of the art of energy optimization and scheduling of EWHs. Secondly, to review the current ML models for energy optimization and scheduling of EWHs in smart grids and smart building environment. While classical control strategies may deliver substantial improvements, optimum efficiency may not be reached. ML has demonstrated clear advantages over classical control.

India being the largest consumer of groundwater in the world, dwindling groundwater storage has emerged as a serious concern in recent years. Consequently, the judicious and efficient management of vital groundwater resources is one of the grand challenges in India. Groundwater modeling is a promising tool to develop sustainable management strategies for the efficient utilization of this treasured resource. This study demonstrates a pragmatic framework for predicting seasonal groundwater levels at a large scale using real-world data. Three relatively powerful Machine Learning (ML) techniques viz., ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were employed for predicting seasonal groundwater levels at the country scale using in situ groundwater-level and pertinent meteorological data of 1996–2016. ANFIS, DNN and SVM models were developed for 18 Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) of India and their efficacy was evaluated using suitable statistical and graphical indicators. The findings of this study revealed that the DNN model is the most proficient in predicting seasonal groundwater levels in most AEZs, followed by the ANFIS model.

Modeling with a gully head erosion susceptibility map (GHEM) is an essential step toward appropriate mitigation measures. This study evaluates the effectiveness of two varieties of advanced data mining techniques—a bivariate statistical model (certainty factor (CF)) and a machine learning model (random forest (RF)) for the accurate mapping of gully head erosion susceptibility taking the Dongzhi Loess Tableland of China as an example at a regional scale. A database comprising 11 geographic and environmental parameters was extracted with 415 spatially distributed gully heads, of which 70% (291) were selected for model training and 30% (124) were used for validation. An accuracy evaluation using the area under the curve (AUC) value revealed that the CF model was 84.1% accurate, while the AUC value of the RF model map was 88.8% accurate. According to the RF method used to assess the relative significance of predictor variables, the most significant factors influencing the spatial distribution of the GHEM were the slope angle, slope aspect, topographic wetness index, and slope length. The GHEM can ultimately aid in decision making with respect to soil planning and management and sustainable development of the study area, which can be applied to other similar loess regions. © 2021","Certainty factor; Gully head; Loess Plateau; Random forest","Data mining; Decision trees; Erosion; Learning systems; Planning; Sediments; Spatial distribution; Sustainable development; Areas under the curves; Certainty factors; Gully head; Land degradation; Loess Plateau; Loess plateau of chinas; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Spatial models; Susceptibility maps; Landforms; data mining; erosion control; gully erosion; land degradation; slope stability; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104308946

Various detection techniques have been developed to identify the oil pollution in natural waters. These techniques mainly focus on large and major oil spills involving significant changes in environmental characteristics. However, monitoring of minor oil spills (from seepage and dripping) in waters remains a bottleneck, allowing inconspicuous and persistent oil contamination. To overcome this drawback, a sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) sensor equipped with a vertical floating cathode is developed for on-line and in-situ monitoring of minor oil spills in natural waters. The vertical floating cathode was intended for recognizing oil on water surface. Oil on the cathode will trigger current drop. Two kinds of natural sediments were adopted in two sensors (SMFC1 from a lake and SMFC2 from an urban stream) for comparison. Both showed linear relationship between net steady-state current decrease and oil dose (30.78 and 27.29 μA/mL of sensitivity, respectively). The current change process was fitted well to a pseudo-first order kinetic equation. A one-point/two-point dynamic identification methods were derived from the kinetic equation. Therefore, the detection time was shortened from 10 h to 10/30 min. The triggered current decrease was mainly attributed to the increase in internal resistance related to charge and mass transfer. Despite the power loss after oil contamination, results implied SMFC sensor could still achieve self-sustainability. This study shows that the SMFC sensor with vertical floating cathodes is applicable to monitoring the unnoticeable minor oil pollutions in natural waters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Current signal; Internal resistance; Oil detection; Pseudo-first order; Sediment microbial fuel cell; Self-sustainability","Aquatic ecosystems; Cathodes; Integral equations; Kinetic energy; Mass transfer; Microbial fuel cells; Potable water; Sediments; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Cell sensor; Current signal; Internal resistance; Natural waters; Oil contamination; Oil detection; Oil pollution; Pseudo-first-order; Sediment microbial fuel cell; Self-sustainability; Oil spills; drinking water; lake water; detection method; floating structure; freshwater environment; fuel cell; oil spill; pollution monitoring; sensor; steady-state equilibrium; sustainability; water pollution; aquatic environment; Article; electrochemical analysis; environmental monitoring; environmental sustainability; mathematical analysis; microbial fuel cell; oil spill; online monitoring; priority journal; sediment; steady state; water pollution; water supply; bioenergy; ecosystem; electrode; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Ecosystem; Electrodes; Geologic Sediments; Petroleum Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103798541

As the cropland expansion took place in Brazil the last decades, leading to significant land-use change and environmental impacts, detailed information about soils is fundamental for sustainable development. Thus, considering the lack of spatially explicit information about cropland soils in Brazil, we aimed at performing high-resolution mapping of key topsoil attributes using spectral and terrain features extracted from Earth observation data (EOD). With the resulting information, we also aimed at performing a general examination of the main agricultural regions and estimate the total organic carbon stocks on croplands soils. For this, we obtained environmental predictors from the historical collection of Landsat data and the digital elevation model from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission at the cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine. The environmental predictors (30 m spatial resolution) with georeferenced soil samples (n = 5097) were used for predicting the topsoil content (0–20 cm) of clay, sand, silt, cation exchange capacity, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) and SOC stock. Prediction models of clay, sand, SOC content, and SOC stocks had the best performance metrics, achieving a R2 ranging from 0.44 to 0.74 and ratio of performance to the interquartile range higher than 1.5. The predicted maps revealed the variability of topsoil among the cropped areas, indicating that the agricultural expansion took place on sandy soils. The SOC stock map provided consistent estimates compared to previous datasets but revealed additional information at the local and regional scales. Thus, this study supports the proposition that EOD is a valuable source for extracting environmental features for mapping and monitoring cropland soils at finer resolutions, assisting the evaluation of soil spatial distribution and the historical agriculture expansion over large geographical areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bare soil composite; Croplands; Digital soil mapping; Google Earth engine; Machine learning; Remote sensing","Agriculture; Engines; Environmental impact; Expansion; Land use; Learning systems; Observatories; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Sustainable development; Bare soil composite; Cropland; Digital soil mappings; Earth observation data; Google earth engine; Machine-learning; Remote-sensing; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Spatial variability; Topsoil; Soils; cation exchange capacity; data set; digital elevation model; Landsat; performance assessment; satellite data; spatial distribution; World Wide Web; Brazil; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103099010

So, decision support tools, on-farm nutrient cycling models, and life cycle assessment tools to assess the sustainability of agricultural production systems that include manure typically use ambient air temperature as a surrogate for manure temperature. This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms' unique abilities to predict manure temperature based on measured data. The data was collected from two on-farm manure storages (clay pit and concrete tank) instrumented with sensors to acquire manure temperature at various depths during the storage period. The local weather data (ambient air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, relative humidity, and rainfall) were recorded by stations installed at each farm. The data were subjected to four machine learning algorithms gradient boosted trees, bagged tree ensembles, random forest ensembles, and neural networks using the supervised learning approach. The weather data and two additional parameters, time (month) and the manure depth above a sensor, were derived and used as inputs for the machine learning algorithms. Further, the developed machine learning algorithms were challenged with parameters from historical weather data (1990 to 2020) to assess their suitability to predict manure temperature where local weather is not available. The results showed that, in general, the stored manure temperature lagged but followed a similar trend as the ambient air temperature and solar radiation. The average manure temperature was higher than the ambient air temperature for most of the year. Depth influenced the manure temperature; manure in the top layers had a higher temperature during warm periods than the bottom layers, and vice versa during cold seasons. The ensemble models performed better than the neural networks by predicting manure temperatures closer to the measured values and predictions during the scenario analysis. The random forests and bagged tree ensembles were the best performers. Models tended to make better predictions as the depth of manure above a sensor increased. This work will provide added value for developing better decision support tools and models for assessing nutrient cycling on farms. It also informs our knowledge to develop emission mitigation strategies during manure storage, leading to more sustainable manure management practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Dairy manure; Machine learning; Manure emissions; Manure storages; Modeling manure temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107583950

Sensors collect the real-time data required to optimise manufacturing processes and are therefore a key technology in this transformation. Ultrasonic sensors have benefits of being low-cost, in-line, non-invasive, and able to operate in opaque systems. Supervised machine learning models can correlate ultrasonic sensor data to useful information about the manufacturing materials and processes. However, this requires a reference measurement of the process material to label each data point for model training. Labelled data is often difficult to obtain in factory environments, and so a method of training models without this is desirable. This work compares two domain adaptation methods to transfer models across processes, so that no labelled data is required to accurately monitor a target process. The two method compared are a Single Feature transfer learning approach and Transfer Component Analysis using three features. Ultrasonic waveforms are unique to the sensor used, attachment procedure, and contact pressure. Therefore, only a small number of transferable features are investigated. Two industrially relevant processes were used as case studies: mixing and cleaning of fouling in pipes. A reflection-mode ultrasonic sensing technique was used, which monitors the sound wave reflected from the interface between the vessel wall and process material. Overall, the Single Feature method produced the highest prediction accuracies: up to 96.0% and 98.4% to classify the completion of mixing and cleaning, respectively; and R2 values of up to 0.947 and 0.999 to predict the time remaining until completion. These results highlight the potential of combining ultrasonic measurements with transfer learning techniques to monitor industrial processes.

However, at that time, there were no possibilities for applying biometric or other kinds of tracking and remote technologies to detect and recognize the emotions felt by other people. The 21st century brought forth such opportunities. Nonetheless, even currently, the remotely integrated, emotional, affective and physiological states, arousal and valence (MAPS) of individuals residing or visiting urban areas are very seldom analysed. Meanwhile stakeholder groups are unable to receive digital advice with a goal to upgrade urban areas to be more pleasant, comfortable and sustainable. In such a context, the authors of this study developed an Affective System for Researching Emotions in Public Spaces for Urban Planning (ASP System). This System has added to the body of knowledge on research in several ways. ASP can prove a helpful supplement to urban planning and public participation practice by gathering and analysing MAPS data of passersby, weather conditions, pollution and other data. This unique combination of MAPS data can assist city stakeholders in initiating effective planning solutions based on an inhabitant-centric method. Additionally ASP employs a neuro decision matrix, which assisted in deriving a comprehensive analysis of the urban areas under deliberation by MAPS parameters. This article also submits eight avenues of practical use for urban planners when employing MAPS data and the ASP Method and System.

Nevertheless, the productivity of rice (3.36 t ha−1) is the lowest in South Asia region. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to employ a mixed-methods approach to characterize and decompose yield gaps (YGs) in the context of identifying sustainable intensification pathways for rice production in Nepal. METHODS: Methodologies include: a) landscape-scale crop diagnostic survey on crop management, field attributes, and productivity outcomes combined with gridded soil and daily weather data to decompose rice yield gaps into constituent factors with machine learning diagnostics; b) with survey data, computation of key performance indicators to identify factors associated with productivity, profitability, and resource use efficiencies; c) complementary multi-location on-farm experiments (2011–2017) evaluating new agronomic management practices; and d) dynamic simulation (ORYZA3) to derive estimates of rice yield potential. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of survey data suggests an exploitable YG of 2.57 t ha−1 (40%) and the total YG of 4.85 t ha−1 (55%) indicating substantial scope for increasing rice yields in Nepal. Frequency of irrigation, amount of late-season rainfall, soil type, amount of early-season rainfall, presence of water stress, soil pH, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer rates are the principal determinants of productivity outcomes in descending ranked order. Efficiency metrics suggest rice farmers in the study region make good use of fertilizer inputs, but since application rates are very low (e.g. most farmers apply &lt;20 kg P ha−1) unsustainable mining of soil nutrients is likely common. Farmers in the top 10% of the yield distribution had lower greenhouse gas emission intensities (−43%), increased water productivity (+66%), and higher use efficiencies of N and P fertilizers (+28% and + 20%, respectively), suggesting that yield intensification can be achieved without tradeoffs with key environmental performance indicators. On-farm experiments conducted over several seasons support insights from surveys by demonstrating that major gains in rice yield (1.86 t ha−1) and profitability (US$ 243 ha−1) are achievable through the adoption of good agronomic practices. SIGNIFICANCE: Through a mixed methods approach, our results suggest that adoption of integrated 'good agronomic practices' can close YGs and improve food security outcomes associated with the rice-based agricultural systems of Nepal while simultaneously preserving or enhancing key sustainability and livelihood objectives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Good agronomic practices; Machine learning; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable intensification; Yield gap","agricultural intensification; agricultural land; alternative agriculture; crop production; crop yield; experimental study; food security; Gross Domestic Product; livelihood; machine learning; profitability; resource use; simulation; survey method; sustainability; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106388838

Technology must be used to conduct on-site investigations of the spatial and non-spatial factors of industrial parks, especially the emerging Eco-Industrial Park (EIP). The paper seeks to appraise the global application, capability and acceptability of Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) tools in the EIP sites selection and planning. Also, to identify the benefits of mixing MCDM tools when integrating with GIS. There have been some reviews on the use of GIS and MCDM methods, but so far, there is none on the role of GIS and MCDM methods in EIP site selection. Geospatial and MCDM tools can be used to carefully select EIP sites, where materials and energy can be shared to achieve cleaner production, reduce environmental pollution and promote sustainable development. To understand the usage of these tools and their role in the EIP site selection process, a critical review of twenty-two papers published from 2007 to 2020 indexed by Google Scholar, Springer, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science have been developed for the first time. The articles are classified based on country/region, journal of publication, year and citations of publication, the authors and technologies applied. The results show that most studies on EIP site selection come from Iran and China. The Journal of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment has the highest number of articles published at 28%. The highest number of articles was published in 2014 with 312 citations. GIS and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) topped the technologies used, accounting for 42% and 24% respectively, and hybrid tools 34%. As categorised by criteria content, there was an overlap of criteria in most journals. Though, water bodies, utilities, infrastructure, and natural characteristics were prominent. Renewable energy resources were not given attention by most researchers, and risk assessment was absent from the site selection literature. A blend of traditional MCDM tools constitutes the state-of-the-art tools, and when these are combined with GIS in EIP site surveys, they execute to obtain actual results. Future EIP site selection that is integrated with risk assessment is envisioned to be industry 4.0 (4IR)-driven through a combination of GIS and artificial intelligence, and the recently developed MCDM hybrid modules. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Eco-industrial park; Geospatial technology; Multi-criteria decision making; Site selection; State-of-the-art",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106229582

During HTT, the organic matter and carbon were mostly solubilized from solid to liquid, while the multivalent metals were concentrated in the solid residue. The more stable characteristics of the digestate cake after HTT eliminated its environmental risk.

To ensure the sustainability of pavements against temperature rise, a county-level methodology based on machine-learning algorithms was developed. To show the applicability of the framework, the Isfahan County was studied. The county's climate was found to change from cold-semi-desert to relatively-warm-semi-desert in future decades. Then, optimal maintenance policies before and after climate change were identified. It was concluded that optimal policies of arterial roads before and after climate change were more intense than those of local roads. Furthermore, optimal policies after climate change were more intense than those before climate change at additional costs of 1379.57 MR/KM and 632.49 MR/KM respectively for arterial and local roads. The same methodology could be applied to sustainably adapt asphalt pavements of other counties. To validate the research, a questionnaire survey of pavement management and climate change experts was done. The experts confirmed that the methodology facilitates achieving sustainable development goals #9, #11, and #13 by improving maintenance budget allocation, enhancing policy-makers communication with authorities, maintaining adequate technical and end-user levels of service, and adapting pavements to climate change through cost-effective and performance-effective maintenance policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Machine-Learning; Markov Chain Model; Sustainable Pavement Maintenance; Temperature Rise","Asphalt; Asphalt pavements; Budget control; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Learning algorithms; Maintenance; Markov processes; Planning; Surveys; Sustainable development; County level; Isfahan; Machine-learning; Maintenance policy; Markov chain models; On-machines; Optimal policies; Pavement maintenance; Sustainable pavement maintenance; Temperature rise; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104967813

Reliability analysis methods are needed to be developed to provide accurate estimations of the safety levels for the complex systems and structures of today. In this paper, a novel hybrid framework for the reliability analysis of engineering systems and structures is extended to reduce the computational burden. The proposed hybrid framework is named as SVR–CFORM and consists of coupling two parts: the first is an enhanced first-order reliability method (FORM) using nonlinear conjugate map (CFORM); the second is an artificial intelligence technique called support vector regression (SVR). The conjugate FORM (CFORM) is adaptively formulated to improve the robustness of the original iterative FORM algorithm, whereas the SVR technique is used to enhance the efficiency of the reliability analysis by reducing the computational burden. The performance of the proposed SVR–CFORM formulation is compared in terms of efficiency and robustness with several FORM formulas (i.e. HL–RF, directional stability transformation method, conjugate HL–RF and finite step length) through different numerical/structural reliability examples. Results indicate that the proposed SVR–CFORM formulation is more accurate and efficient than other reliability methods. Based on the comparative analysis results, the SVR technique can highly reduce the computational costs and accurately model the response of complex performance functions, while the iterative CFORM formulation found to provide stable and robust reliability index results compared to the others reliability methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; First-order reliability method (FORM); Hybrid reliability method; Nonlinear conjugate map; Structural reliability; Support vector regression (SVR)","Complex networks; Computational efficiency; Efficiency; Iterative methods; Large scale systems; Nonlinear analysis; Numerical methods; Regression analysis; Reliability analysis; Computational burden; First order reliability methods; First-order reliability method; Hybrid framework; Hybrid reliability method; Nonlinear conjugate map; Regression techniques; Structural reliability; Support vector regression; Support vector regressions; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103961561

In this research, an innovative artificial intelligence technique i.e. Multi-Expression Programming (MEP) is applied to model the split tensile strength (ST) and modulus of elasticity (E) of concrete containing waste foundry sand (CWFS). The presented formulations correlate mechanical properties with four input variables i.e. w/c, foundry sand content, superplasticizer content and compressive strength. The results of statistical analysis validate the model accuracy as evident by the low values of objective function (0.033 for E and 0.052 for ST). Moreover, the average error in the predicted values is significantly low i.e. 0.287 MPa and 1.75 GPa for ST and E model, respectively.

Characterization of the soil microbial community was an early means to quantify the increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) content and stability under different cropping systems. However, the effects of different cropping systems on the soil microbial community and enzyme activity and the driving force for increasing the SOC content remain unclear, especially the differences between continuous maize (Zea mays L.) cropping and rotation systems containing legumes. We used a long-term field experiment (30 years) in the Mollisol region of Northeast China. The field experiment was undertaken in split-plot design comprised of four treatments: i) farmland fallow (FALL), ii) continuous soybean cropping (CSC), iii) maize-soybean rotation (MSR), iv) continuous maize cropping (CMC). Fluorometric assays and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) were used to determine the biological characteristics of the soil. The SOC chemical composition was characterized using Cross Polarization/Magic Angle Spinning solid-state 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopy. Principal component analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) and the partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) were used to explore the coupling mediation of these parameters further. Our results suggested that soil microbes in the four systems were not limited by C and N, but co-limited by P. But compared with the FALL system, the CMC system significantly alleviated the phosphorus limitation of the microorganisms. The CMC system also significantly increased soil nutrient content, especially SOC content (40.8%), available phosphorus (117%), available potassium (30.3%), NO3−-N (148%), and increased microbial community abundance and enzyme activities. Compared with the CMC system, the MSR system held relatively lower Gram-positive: Gram-negative ratio and higher fungi: bacteria ratio, which indicated that the soil microbial community structure is more conducive to improving the SOC stability. Meanwhile, more evidence supporting data that SOC stability was enhanced in MSR soils was provided by the 13C NMR spectra and higher-quality indices (A / AO, AI, HI and LCI). Moreover, strong correlations and RDA analysis confirmed that SOC is the main factor affecting microbial communities and enzyme activities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","13C NMR; Crop rotation; Enzyme activity; Microbial community; PLS-PM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101820908

To attain this goal, the efficiency of MBRs needs to be high, and they should be sustainable, reliable and cost-effective. Adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to have a positive impact on these criteria. This paper covers the AI-based models used in the treatment of wastewater from various sources, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each model. The existing gaps to push for the commercialization of MBR technologies are discussed to provide state-of-the-art insights for future research. The conclusions and discussions presented in this review show that AI models are useful to predict the performance of MBR technologies to recover clean water from polluted sources. However, further efforts are still needed to reach an excellent match between the predictions made by the AI-based techniques and the experimental results to deal with high strength and highly polluted effluents. This can be achieved through modification and/or integration of the existing AI-based methods. Also, the development of appropriate variables to optimize the performance of MBRs, and improving their efficiency to deal with recalcitrant pollutants such as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are among the priorities to promote the application of MBR technologies in real-scale applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Fouling; Membrane bioreactors; Operating parameters; Sustainability; Wastewater","Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Effluents; Wastewater treatment; Clean waters; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Cost effective; High strength; MBR technology; Membrane bioreactor; Membrane bioreactor technology; State of the art; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099516495

Scientific advances have led to a better understanding of how various components of the agricultural system interact, from the cell to the field level. Despite incredible advances in genetic tools over the past few decades, our ability to accurately assess crop status in the field, at scale, has been severely lacking until recently.

Herein, we report an environmentally friendly and salt-responsive zwitterionic polymer brush based on enzymatic lignin nanoparticles (EHL) prepared by intramolecular self-assembly as a fluid-loss additive (EHL-ASN) for WDFs by the anti-polyelectrolyte effect to overcome the issues of wellbore instability and collapse caused by the deterioration of rheological and filtration properties of WDFs due to electrolyte invasion in drilling high salinity reservoirs and reveal the salt response mechanism of EHL-ASN. The ascending viscosity of EHL-ASN solution corresponded to the heightening of electrolyte salinity, which revealed that EHL-ASN solution had obvious salt response. The biological toxicity evaluation of EHL-ASN exhibited that its half maximal effective concentration (EC50) was 51,900 mg/L, which accorded with the direct emission standard. Additionally, the results for rheological and fluid-loss performance evaluation of EHL-ASN/WDFs promulgated that EHL-ASN had significant effects on heightening viscosity and debasing fluid-loss, in which, EHL-ASN could significantly debase the fluid-loss (FLAPI) of saturated salt-based mud (SSBM) from 194 mL to 4 mL, with a decline rate of 97.9%.

Nevertheless, the leaching and efficient separation of the precious metals from NCM active cathode material via an environmentally benign and economical process is still challenging. Therefore, in this research, we present a novel and energy an efficient route through which to leach valuable metals, for example, lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn) from the NCM cathode material of the waste LIBs using water-containing waste chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in a batch reactor. Parameters such as temperature, time, liquid-solid, and mass ratios on the extraction efficiencies of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn were carefully examined. The outcomes show that CPVC performed better than PVC for the extraction of valuable metals from NCM material, and this was attributed to its high Cl contents. The maximum extraction efficiencies of Li, Ni, Co, and Mn (99.15%, 98.10%, 99.30%, and 100%, respectively) were achieved under optimized reaction conditions: a temperature of 290 °C, reaction time of 1 h, a liquid-solid ratio 60:1 mL/g and solid to solid mass ratio of 1:3.

This is particularly important in Southeast Queensland, Australia, which is projected to be significantly impacted by climate change. We have developed an integrated catchment modelling framework for the Nerang River catchment that combines a hydrologic model, a reservoir operation model, and a hydrodynamic river model. The multi-model ensemble is used to investigate eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) over the baseline period (2000–2009) and one future period (2075–2084). Additionally, the tidal section of the Lower Nerang River was studied under coupled impacts of the RCP scenarios and sea level rise by 0.80 m. The ensemble projections over the future period present slight decreasing tendencies in the median of monthly long-term daily inflow to Hinze Dam in the upper Nerang River. Additionally, the average environmental releases of 7.25 ML/day are expected to reduce over the future period by 6.02% and 5.37% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively compared to the baseline period. The hydrodynamic model results revealed that sea level rise is projected to have significant impact on water level variations at two river flooding alert sites, Carrara Alert and Evandale Alert. As a result, a 0.80 m sea level rise can increase ensemble water level projections by almost 0.75 m and 0.80 m at Carrara Alert and Evandale Alert sites, respectively, which will cause minor to major flooding events at Evandale Alert site. The outcomes of the present paper can assist the decision-makers and the community of the Nerang River catchment with a robust tool to evaluate climate change scenarios for sustainable future water resources management and allocation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ensemble projections; Hydrodynamic model; Hydrologic model; Integrated catchment model; Reservoir operation model","Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Decision making; Floods; Hydrodynamics; Reservoir management; Rivers; Runoff; Sea level; Water levels; Water management; Australia; Catchment management; Ensemble projection; Hydrodynamic modeling; Hydrologic models; Integrated catchment model; Multi-model ensemble; Reservoir operation model; River catchment; Sea level rise; Reservoirs (water); catchment; climate change; ensemble forecasting; hydrodynamics; hydrological modeling; reservoir; sea level change; water management; Article; climate change; concentration (parameter); conceptual framework; dam (barrier); decision making; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; flooding; hydrodynamics; hydrological model; hydrology; outcome assessment; priority journal; Queensland; resource allocation; river basin; sea level rise; water flow; water management; water supply; Australia; Nerang River; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102482006

These bio-composites not only enhance the thermal performance of buildings but also promote sustainable development due to their eco-friendly nature. Due to their highly heterogeneous nature, however, most of the existing studies on the bio-composites have only focused on experimental investigations, while mathematical modeling of physical, thermal and mechanical properties of bio-composite remains a challenge for the researchers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI) based gene expression programming (GEP) technique is used to develop the mathematical models for predicting the dry density, compressive strength and thermal conductivity of hemp-based bio-composites. A large amount of database was established based on past studies and the most influential parameters were identified by several trial analyses. The proposed mathematical models showed a high correlation with the experimental results. All the models passed the statistical and performance index checks showing strong predictability, generalization capability and high accuracy of GEP-AI models.

In this study, we found that Brucea javanica (L.) Merr. residue has herbicidal activity and can be used for weed control in the field, this prompted us to investigate the active constituents in it. The herbicidal activities of extracts of B. javanica residue were evaluated by conducting bioassays against gramineous weed, Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn. and broad-leaved weed, Bidens pilosa L., respectively. It confirmed that ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts possessed potent biological activities on seed germination and seedling growth of E. indica at 5 mg/mL. This prompted us to investigate the active constituents in the seeds residue. By the activity-guided fractionation, eight known compounds were isolated, which were bruceines D−F (1–3), pityriacitrin (4), 4-(9H-β-carbolin-1-yl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acid methyl ester (5), protocatechuic acid (6), vanillic acid (7) and carisphthalate (8). Then, three quassinoids (1–3) were evaluated for their potential herbicidal effects in bioassay. Results showed that bruceines D−F have potential herbicidal activity against the test weeds. In the range of experimental concentration, bruceine D had obvious herbicidal effect on the two tested weeds. At the concentration of 31.25 μg/mL, bruceine D could completely inhibit the root growth of E. indica; at the concentration of 125 μg/mL, bruceine D can inhibit the seed germination and shoot elongation of E. indica and the shoot growth of B. pilosa, with the inhibition reached 100%. In addition, at the same concentration (250 μg/mL), bruceines D−F could completely affected shoot elongation of B. pilosa. These results showed that B. javanica residue is a potential source of botanical herbicide development, which has great agricultural economic value, at the same time, the reuse of B. javanica residue realizes the transformation of waste into treasure, rational utilization of resources and sustainable development. © 2021","Brucea javanica (L.)

We used a total of 1 244 624 independent incidents from the Valencian emergency medical dispatch service in Spain, compiled in retrospective from 2009 to 2012, including clinical features, demographics, circumstantial factors and free text dispatcher observations. Based on them, we designed and developed DeepEMC2, a deep ensemble multitask model integrating four subnetworks: three specialized to context, clinical and text data, respectively, and another to ensemble the former. The four subnetworks are composed in turn by multi-layer perceptron modules, bidirectional long short-term memory units and a bidirectional encoding representations from transformers module. DeepEMC2 showed a macro F1-score of 0.759 in life-threatening classification, 0.576 in admissible response delay and 0.757 in emergency system jurisdiction. These results show a substantial performance increase of 12.5 %, 17.5 % and 5.1 %, respectively, with respect to the current in-house triage protocol of the Valencian emergency medical dispatch service. Besides, DeepEMC2 significantly outperformed a set of baseline machine learning models, including naive bayes, logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting (α = 0.05). Hence, DeepEMC2 is able to: 1) capture information present in emergency medical calls not considered by the existing triage protocol, and 2) model complex data dependencies not feasible by the tested baseline models. Likewise, our results suggest that most of this unconsidered information is present in the free text dispatcher observations. To our knowledge, this study describes the first deep learning model undertaking emergency medical call incidents classification. Its adoption in medical dispatch centers would potentially improve emergency dispatch processes, resulting in a positive impact in patient wellbeing and health services sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Emergency medical calls; Emergency medical dispatch; Ensemble learning; Medical emergencies; Multitask learning","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Deep learning; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Multilayer neural networks; Predictive analytics; Baseline machines; Clinical features; Emergency medical dispatches; Gradient boosting; Multi layer perceptron; Multitask classifications; Predictive modeling; Short term memory; Emergency services; adoption; adult; article; Bayesian learning; clinical feature; controlled study; deep learning; demography; emergency medical dispatch; female; human; major clinical study; male; multilayer perceptron; primary medical care; random forest; short term memory; Spain; wellbeing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107308915

These materials are incorporated to improve sustainability and reduce the extent and severity of distresses such as rutting and low-temperature cracking. Currently, there is a lack of a robust real-time method for the identification of these additives in mixtures. In this research, portable molecular sensing technology is introduced and implemented to classify asphalt binders modified with ground tire rubber (GTR) and asphalt mixtures containing different amounts of recycled materials. To this end, binder samples and gyratory asphalt specimens were fabricated and scanned using a pocket-sized near-infrared (NIR) molecular sensor. The NIR sensor functions by illuminating the mixture surface and performing a spectral analysis on the measured reflected light in the wavelength range of 760–1040 nm. The fingerprint of the bituminous materials can then be used to classify an unknown asphalt binder and mixtures. After developing the data set containing the spectrum in near-infrared range, a robust machine learning (ML) algorithm called support vector machine (SVM) was trained using the extracted wavelengths. The developed ML model was then used to classify new binders and mixtures based on the captured spectra. Given the high accuracy of classification outputs, this advanced technology can provide a promising tool to accurately differentiate and classify various types of asphalt binders and mixtures. This monitoring and data collection framework can contribute to improved sustainability via accelerating and optimizing the construction material detection and selection process throughout the pavement life. Also, tracking the aging level of the asphalt pavements could help the road authorities to apply and appropriate timely rehabilitation strategies. From an environmental impact standpoint, the expensive and time and energy-consuming process of binder extraction and recovery that involves the application of toxic solvents (e.g. Trichloroethylene) could be avoided. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Asphalt mixtures; Classification; Machine learning; Near-infrared; Rubber modified binders; Support vector machine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105846445

The model is mainly composed of an integrated ecohydrological model, a socioeconomic model, and two interface models. It has been embedded into a decision support system using the surrogate modeling technique. The watershed system model proved to be reliable in simulating multiple eco-hydrological processes, and showed good abilities in exploring the trajectories and interactions of water, ecology and socioeconomy.

In particular, sustainability analyses require information on the coffee bean mass and property changes during processing, from harvest to final consumption. In this study, a detailed analysis of the washed or wet-processed method for coffee postharvest processing is provided. Mass flow data were collected through site visits, surveys, laboratory measurements, and interviews with coffee wet and dry mill operators in several countries throughout Central America and Mexico, as well as roasters and cafés in the United States, to establish representative mass flow rates and process flow diagrams from harvest to cup. Results indicate that 100 kg of harvested coffee cherries will on average yield 2.6 kg of mass consumed by humans as exported coffee, equivalent to approximately 839 metric cups (250 ml) of drip brew coffee or 897 metric shots (30 ml) of espresso. The remaining 97.4 kg provide opportunities for development of alternative products, and other economic uses.

Thus, it is difficult to carry out real-time prediction of project performance. In the context of energy and environmental crises, a real-time prediction method for the sustainable development performance of IES projects based on conditional generative adversarial networks-long short-term memory neural networks was proposed after a full study of the park-level IES projects in Tianjin, China. In this study, an evaluation system for the sustainable development performance of IES projects, such as “integrated energy efficiency,” was established to collect the monthly performance index values of 638 IES projects in Tianjin in 2017. The monthly performance evaluation index was calculated using the entropy weight method. After sorting, a binary method was applied to form the monthly performance evaluation label values,""1″ corresponding to the top 50% of the project, “0″ corresponding to the bottom 50% projects, establishing a database of historical project performance. The generator in CGAN game training was initially used to learn the mapping relationship between the noise distribution under the predicted conditions and the historical IES project performance data set, resulting in 6220 project data with similar distribution, with improved generalization ability of online data mining and accuracy of the stabilization algorithm. LSTM was then used to capture the time dependence in IES project performance data characteristics to predict monthly sustainable performance after 12 months of project operation. Compared with other machine learning models, this method is time-adaptive and the model structure is simple. The average response time of performance prediction for the same park was shortened to 2.76 months, and the prediction accuracy increased to 98.75%. Three schemes were designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the real data of the park-level IES project in Tianjin with the predicted results. These results have practical significance for strengthening the real-time control of integrated energy projects and for effectively promoting the sustainable development of the integrated energy industry. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Conditional generative adversarial networks; Integrated energy system; Long short-term memory; Park level integrated energy system; Sustainable performance prediction","Brain; Data mining; Energy efficiency; Long short-term memory; Parks; Planning; Real time control; Sustainable development; Conditional generative adversarial network; Integrated energy systems; Park level integrated energy system; Performance prediction; Project performance; Real-time prediction; Short term memory; Sustainable performance; Sustainable performance prediction; Tianjin; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104579458

The identity of the efficient laccase-producing isolate was confirmed by using a molecular approach. Fermentation conditions for laccase production were optimized, and laccase biochemical properties were studied. Results: Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the isolate coded as HWP3 was identified as Streptomyces sp. LAO. The time-course study showed that the isolate optimally produced laccase at 84 h with 40.58 ± 2.35 U/mL activity. The optimized physicochemical conditions consisted of pH 5.0, ferulic acid (0.04%; v/v), pine back (0.2 g/L), urea (1.0 g/L), and lactose (1 g/L). Streptomyces sp. LAO laccase was optimally active at pH and temperature of 8.0 and 90 °C, respectively, with remarkable pH and thermal stability. Furthermore, the enzyme had a sufficient tolerance for organic solvents after 16 h of preincubation, with laccase activity &gt; 70%. Additionally, the laccase maintained considerable residual activity after pretreatment with 100 mM of chemical agents, including sodium dodecyl sulphate (69.93 ± 0.89%), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (93.1 ± 7.85%), NaN3 (96.28 ± 3.34%) and urea (106.03 ± 10.72%).

Energy prediction models provide critical information to decision-makers who develop sustainability policies to reduce energy use and emissions. We present a transportation energy model (TEM) that uses Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to predict household transportation energy consumption in this study. The TEM model uses data-driven approaches for household transportation energy prediction. Machine learning techniques in artificial intelligence (AI) predictive modeling have become popular due to their ability to capture nonlinear and complex relationships. On the other hand, developing comprehensive understanding the inference mechanisms in AI models and ensuring trust in their predictions is challenging. This is because AI models are mostly of high complexity and low interpretability; in other words, they are black-box models. This study presents a case study of how model transparency and explanation can be generated using the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) to support advanced machine learning techniques in the transportation energy field. The methodology has been implemented based on the Household Travel Survey (HTS) data, which is used to train the artificial neural network with a relatively high degree of accuracy. The importance and effect (local explanation) of HTS inputs (such as household travel, demographics, and neighborhood data) on transportation energy consumption for specific traffic analysis zones (TAZs) are analyzed. The results are valuable to promote intelligent and user-friendly transportation energy planning models in urban regions across the world. © 2021","Artificial neural network; Explainable artificial intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; LIME; Transportation energy use; Urban metabolism","Complex networks; Decision making; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Lime; Machine learning; Neural networks; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Complex relationships; Data-driven approach; High degree of accuracy; Household travel surveys; Machine learning techniques; Sustainability policy; Traffic analysis zones; Transportation energy consumption; Predictive analytics; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; energy planning; energy use; household energy; machine learning; transportation; transportation planning; urban region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104303690

The TES functions efficiently with electrolyte reuse and supplementation without any reduction in productivity. Gradual electrolyte supplementation (0.5 mL min−1) resulted in 75% higher yield than the non-supplemented system. TEM and XRD analyses confirmed the presence of Fe3O4. TES enables the use of a new reaction parameter—flow rate—for controlling SPION properties. Increasing electrolyte flow rate caused a decrease in SPION average size and size distribution. TES offers advantages of scalability and sustainability for large-scale production of Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

The adverse effects of physical violence bear a considerable impact on children's physical and psychological development resulting in both short and long-term issues. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore whether children with cognitive and social-emotional difficulties (CSEDs) were at a higher risk of experiencing physical abuse and whether mothers’ views on intimate partner violence (IPV) were also related to physical abuse against children. Participants and Setting: The Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey-2019 was used with a sample of 27,086 children aged 5–14. Methods: Generalized linear modelling along with a machine learning method of classification trees was employed to investigate the important sociodemographic characteristics and identify the most vulnerable groups of children based on their likelihood of exposure to household-violence. Results: Nearly 62.5 % of the children were physically abused by their mothers. Children with CSEDs were 53 % (OR 1.53; 95 % CI: 1.41, 1.67) more likely to experience physical abuse and mothers’ justification of IPV was associated with a 16 % higher risk (OR 1.16; 95 % CI: 1.08, 1.26). Moreover, younger children aged 11 or below belonged to the high-risk groups of experiencing abuse. Conclusions: The findings suggest that violence against children is widespread in Bangladesh, especially in children having CSEDs. Mothers’ acceptance of IPV was also associated with increased abusive practice against children. Sincere focus on these issues is imperative if Bangladesh intends to achieve the sustainable development goal 16.2 of eradicating all forms of violence against children and ensure their safe development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Child abuse; Cognitive difficulty; Machine learning; Physical violence; Social-emotional; Sociodemographic","adolescent; article; Bangladesh; child; child abuse; demography; female; high risk population; household; human; human experiment; machine learning; major clinical study; mother; partner violence; physical abuse; physical violence; preschool child; risk assessment; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103322229

An annual map for Phuket created using the proposed method was compared to the official map released by the Thai government for the year 2018. The two maps did not differ significantly, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. Annual maps were then produced for several years to assess the effect of land use change in the past 19 years on the environmental and sustainable management in Phuket.

The results showed that the proposed model can predict the relative liking food ratings with higher performance (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.8), as compared to traditional ANNs using feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) (R2 = 0.61, RMSE = 1.1) and statistical mixed models (R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 1.8). This model was used to find the threshold level that gives maximum relative food liking ratings for different types of noise. This threshold level varied between 30 and 35 dBA for three noise types. The liking of food in the presence of background noise depends on acoustic and non-acoustic factors. A feature analysis using the “RReliefF” algorithm was used to investigate the relative importance of these acoustic and non-acoustic factors on the relative food liking using predicted model outcomes.

Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of processes for biodiesel production and use, fast and accurate modeling tools are required for their design, optimization, monitoring, and control. Data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated superior predictive capability compared to conventional methods for modeling such highly complex processes. Among the available ML techniques, the artificial neural network (ANN) technology is the most widely used approach in biodiesel research. The ANN approach is a computational learning method that mimics the human brain's neurological processing ability to map input-output relationships of ill-defined systems. Given its high generalization capacity, ANN has gained popularity in dealing with complex nonlinear real-world engineering and scientific problems. This paper is devoted to thoroughly reviewing and critically discussing various ML technology applications, with a particular focus on ANN, to solve function approximation, optimization, monitoring, and control problems in biodiesel research. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of using ML technology in biodiesel research are highlighted to direct future R&D efforts in this domain. ML technology has generally been used in biodiesel research for modeling (trans)esterification processes, physico-chemical characteristics of biodiesel, and biodiesel-fueled internal combustion engines. The primary purpose of introducing ML technology to the biodiesel industry has been to monitor and control biodiesel systems in real-time; however, these issues have rarely been explored in the literature. Therefore, future studies appear to be directed towards the use of ML techniques for real-time process monitoring and control of biodiesel systems to enhance production efficiency, economic viability, and environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Biodiesel systems; Control; Machine learning; Modeling; Transesterification","Biodiesel; Complex networks; Machine learning; Neural networks; Process monitoring; Real time systems; Sustainable development; Environmental sustainability; Function approximation; Generalization capacity; Machine learning technology; Physicochemical characteristics; Predictive capabilities; Real-time process monitoring; Technology application; Process control",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102241821

In 2006, Procaccia and Rosenschein considered a utilitarian social choice setting, where the agents have explicit numerical values for the alternatives, yet they only report their linear orderings over them. To compare different aggregation mechanisms, Procaccia and Rosenschein introduced the notion of distortion, which quantifies the inefficiency of using only ordinal information when trying to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the sum of the underlying values of the agents for the chosen outcome. Since then, this research area has flourished and bounds on the distortion have been obtained for a wide variety of fundamental scenarios. However, the vast majority of the existing literature is focused on the case where nothing is known beyond the ordinal preferences of the agents over the alternatives. In this paper, we take a more expressive approach, and consider mechanisms that are allowed to further ask a few cardinal queries in order to gain partial access to the underlying values that the agents have for the alternatives. With this extra power, we design new deterministic mechanisms that achieve significantly improved distortion bounds and, in many cases, outperform the best-known randomized ordinal mechanisms. We paint an almost complete picture of the number of queries required by deterministic mechanisms to achieve specific distortion bounds. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Distortion; Mechanisms; Queries; Social choice","Artificial intelligence; Aggregation mechanism; Collective decision; Deterministic mechanism; Linear orderings; Numerical values; Ordinal information; Ordinal preference; Social choice theory; Decision theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101816518

However, there are numerous challenges facing the development of a rapid, effective, and fine-grained method to assess large-scale greenspace perception. Survey-based studies of perception yielded detailed assessments of green spaces but lacked regional comparisons. The few big-data-based studies of greenspace perception lacked fine-grained explorations. Therefore, we used content analysis to interpret perception in two ways: perceived frequency and perceived satisfaction, including overall park satisfaction and satisfaction with individual landscape features. We analyzed social media posts about urban parks in Beijing, China. A structured lexicon was developed to capture detailed landscape features, and machine learning was employed to assess satisfaction levels. Both of these techniques performed well in interpreting greenspace satisfaction from volunteered textual comments. A detailed study of 50 parks demonstrated that overall park satisfaction was positive. Additionally, individual landscape features were more influential than frequency of landscape features in affecting satisfaction. Our framework confirmed the potential of online comments as complementary to traditional surveys in assessing greenspace perception, while enhancing our understanding of this perception on a regional scale. Practically, this study can facilitate sustainable policy-making regarding urban green spaces, specifically through offering a structured landscape-feature lexicon, rapid regional comparison of various parks, and an emphasis on quality rather than quantity of landscape features. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Green infrastructure; Landscape perception; Landscape planning; Sustainable urbanism; Urban ecology; Urban parks","Machine learning; Social networking (online); Surveys; Beijing , China; Content analysis; Fine grained; Green spaces; Landscape feature; Regional scale; Sustainable policies; Urban green spaces; Electronic assessment; greenspace; infrastructure; landscape planning; machine learning; park management; perception; social media; sustainability; urban area; urbanization; adult; article; big data; China; content analysis; ecology; human; landscape; machine learning; management; perception; recreational park; satisfaction; social media; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101563243

A monopoly-holding platform hires a manager to attract new members from both sides of the market while considering uncertainty on the adhesion of viewers and online gamers. First, we mathematically demonstrate that increasing cross-group network externalities can decrease the platform’s profit, which contradicts a canonical result from the field of two-sided markets. Moreover, knowing that the intermediary’s goal is aligned with the private interest of online gamers, machine learning models empirically show that the main theoretical outcome is observed in reality due to the presence of heterogeneous indirect network effects in online gaming activities. Second, we conclude that social welfare can be either harmed or improved for increasing cross-group network externalities, which means that the professionalization of online gaming may or may not be legitimized depending on the value taken by exogenous parameters related to the platform’s uncertainty on the number of agents that get on board, risk aversion of viewers, and royalty rate applied to online gamers.

Information and research on soil salinity using remote sensing (RS) technology provide a quick and accurate assessment and solutions to address this problem. This study aims to compare the capabilities of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI in RS prediction and exploration of the potential application of derivatives to RS prediction of salinized soils. It explores the ability of derivatives to be used in the Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI multispectral data, and it was used as a data source as well as to address the adaptability of salinity prediction on a regional scale. The two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) optimal spectral indices are used to screen the bands that are most sensitive to soil salinity (0–10 cm), and RS data and topographic factors are combined with machine learning to construct a comprehensive soil salinity estimation model based on gray correlation analysis. The results are as follows: (1) The optimal spectral index (2D, 3D) can effectively consider possible combinations of the bands between the interaction effects and responding to sensitive bands of soil properties to circumvent the problem of applicability of spectral indices in different regions; (2) Both the Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI multispectral RS data sources, after the first-order derivative techniques are all processed, show improvements in the prediction accuracy of the model; (3) The best performance/accuracy of the predictive model is for sentinel data under first-order derivatives.

In most developing countries, conventional system of MSW management approach has been found inadequate due to complex nature of MSW. This study presents a system dynamics (SD) model to predict generation, collection, treatment and landfill capacity of MSW until the year of 2050 to analyze the necessity for MSW management for the coastal city of Khulna, Bangladesh. Simulation results show that MSW generation increases from 168 thousand tons in year 2020 to 1.2 million tons with a per capita generation from 0.117 tons to 0.561 tons by year 2050. The total fund required for collection and landfill capacity also increases, while treatment capacity decreases over time, resulting a piling up of massive amount of uncleared MSW of 10.3 million tons in year 2050 from 152 thousand tons in year 2020. The uncleared and untreated MSW, composite index and public concern increases with time in an exponential nature for the projection period of next thirty years. The population in this model is considered as the only linear growth factor which increases from 1.5 million in year 2020 to 2.24 million by year 2050. The developed SD model also shows that the policy of only to increase collection capacity with the increased allocation of budget is not adequate for improving environmental sustainability, rather an increase of budget is essential for developing MSW treatment facility. In this study, validation methods including behavior sensitivity, data sensitivity and dimensional consistency in extreme condition has been performed to validate the model. The outcome of this SD model can be used as a dynamic testing module for MSW management policy analysis and strategic measures that can be implemented effectively in the context of developing counties. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Decision making simulation; Khulna city; Municipal solid waste; Municipal solid waste management; Sensitivity analysis; System dynamics model","Article; artificial intelligence; Bangladesh; controlled study; decision making; environmental sustainability; mathematical model; municipal solid waste; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; solid waste management; city; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; Bangladesh; Cities; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106254845

Customer profiling based on household water consumption data collected through digital water meters helps to identify the water consumption patterns and habits of customers. This study employed advanced customer profiling techniques adapted from the machine learning research domain to analyse high-resolution data collected from residential digital water meters. Data analytics techniques were applied on already disaggregated end-use water consumption data (e.g., shower and taps) for creating in-depth customer profiling at various intervals (e.g., 15, 30, and 60 min). The developed user profiling approach has some learning functionality as it can ascertain and accommodate changing behaviours of residential customers. The developed advanced user profiling technique was shown to be beneficial since it identified residential customer behaviours that were previously unseen. Furthermore, the technique can identify and address novel changes in behaviours, which is an important feature for promoting and sustaining long-term water conservation behaviours. The research has implications for researchers in data analytics and water demand management, and also for practitioners and government policy advisors seeking to conserve valuable potable-water resources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Behaviour change; Digital water meter; Recommender system; User profiling; Water conservation; Water consumption data","detection method; instrumentation; machine learning; sustainability; water demand; water management; water resource; Article; behavior change; database management system; household; human; machine learning; public policy; water conservation; water management; water supply; water supply; water; Water; Water Resources; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103336108

Increasing number of vehicles require more and more urban land to be allocated for parking. However, a little attention has been conferred to the parking issues in developing countries like India. This study proposes a model for analysing the influence of car user's socioeconomic and travel characteristics on parking duration. Specifically, artificial neural network (ANN) is deployed to capture the interrelationship between driver's characteristics and parking duration. ANNs are highly efficient in learning and recognizing connections between parameters for best prediction of an outcome. Since, utility of ANNs has been critically limited due to its ‘Black Box’ nature, the study involves the use of Garson's algorithm and Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) for model interpretations. LIME shows the prediction for any classification, by approximating it locally with the developed interpretable model. This study is based on microdata collected on-site through interview surveys considering two land-uses: office-business and market/shopping. Results revealed the higher probability of prediction through LIME and therefore, the methodology can be adopted ubiquitously. Further, the policy implications are discussed based on the results for both land-uses. This unique study could lead to enhanced parking policy and management to achieve the sustainability goals. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Central business district (CBD); Interpretable models; Land-use; Neural networks; Parking; Transport policy","Developing countries; Economics; Forecasting; Lime; Machine learning; Neural networks; Public policy; Black boxes; Central business district; Garson's algorithms; Interpretable model; Machine learning approaches; Neural-networks; Number of vehicles; Socio-economics; Transport policy; Urban land use; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102075471

Thus, deploying robust machine learning tools to overcome the lack of understanding of the implications of incorporating such sustainable materials is of paramount importance. Accordingly, this study proposes a gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) model to determine the carbonation depth of recycled aggregate concrete incorporating different mineral additions, including metakaolin, blast furnace slag, silica fume, and fly ash. For this purpose, a database comprising 713 pertinent experimental data records was retrieved from peer-reviewed publications and used for model development and testing. Furthermore, predictions of the GBRT model were compared with calculations of available mathematical formulations to determine the carbonation depth in concrete. The results demonstrate that the machine learning methodology outperformed all the mathematical models considered in this study. The GBRT proved to be a robust tool that could be used to provide an insight into the resistance of concrete to carbonation and could be extended to predicting other features of concrete incorporating diverse recycled materials. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonation; Gradient boosting; Machine learning; Model; Recycled aggregate concrete; Regression trees; Supplementary cementitious materials","Adaptive boosting; Blast furnaces; Carbonation; Concrete aggregates; Fly ash; Forecasting; Forestry; Machine learning; Silica fume; Slags; Boosting regression trees; Carbonation depth; Gradient boosting; Learning tool; Machine-learning; Recycled aggregate concrete; Recycled aggregates; Regression tree models; Regression trees; Supplementary cementitious material; Recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103076298

In this paper, the design of a Neural Network (NN)-based prediction model of a greenhouse’s internal air temperature, to be deployed and run on an edge device with constrained capabilities, is investigated. The model relies on a time series-oriented approach, taking as input variables the past and present values of the air temperature to forecast the future ones. In detail, we evaluate three different NN architecture types—namely, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent NNs (RNNs) and Artificial NNs (ANNs)—with various values of the sliding window associated with input data. Experimental results show that the three best-performing models have a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value in the range 0.289 ÷ 0.402 °C, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the range of 0.87 ÷ 1.04%, and a coefficient of determination (R2) not smaller than 0.997.

Nevertheless, studies on the spatial-temporal changes in global HDDs and their determinants are scarce. This study used multi-source data and several methods to explore the rules of the spatial distribution of global HDDs and their interannual changes over the past 49 years and some critical determinants. The results show that global HDDs generally became larger in regions with higher latitudes and altitudes. Most global change rates of HDDs were negative (p &lt; 0.10) and decreased to a greater extent in areas with higher latitudes. Most global HDDs showed sustainability trends in the future. Both the HDDs and their change rates were significantly partially correlated with latitude, altitude, mean albedo, and EVI during winter, annual mean PM2.5 concentration, and nighttime light intensity (p = 0.000). The HDDs and their change rates could be simulated well by the machine learning method. Their RMSEs were 564.08◦ C * days and 3.59◦ C * days * year−1, respectively.

This study used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage data (TWS), Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) precipitation data and Climate Research Unit (CRU) temperature data. Four general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 were downscaled using the best of four downscaling methods. Two machine learning (ML) models, RF and SVM, were developed to simulate GRACE TWS data for the period 2002–2016 and were then used for the projection of spatiotemporal changes in TWS. The projected TWS data were used to assess the spatiotemporal changes in water availability and sustainability based on the reliability–resiliency–vulnerability (RRV) concept. This study revealed that linear scaling was the best for downscaling over Nigeria. RF had better performance than SVM in modeling TWS for the study area. This study also revealed there would be decreases in water storage during the wet season (June–September) and increases in the dry season (January–May). Decreases in projected water availability were in the range of 0–12 mm for the periods 2010–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099 under RCP2.6 and in the range of 0–17 mm under RCP8.5 during the wet season. Spatially, annual changes in water storage are expected to increase in the northern part and decrease in the south, particularly in the country’s southeast. Groundwater sustainability was higher during the period 2070–2099 under all RCPs compared to the other periods and this can be attributed to the expected increases in rainfall during this period. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to a lack of reliable disposal pathways, acid whey currently presents a major sustainability challenge to the dairy industry. The study presented in this paper proposes a solution to this issue by transforming yogurt acid whey (YAW) into potentially palatable and marketable beverages through yeast fermentation. In this study, five prototypes were developed and fermented by Kluyveromyces marxianus, Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Brettanomyces claussenii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain: Hornindal kveik), and IOC Be Fruits (IOCBF) S. cerevisiae, respectively. Their fermentation profiles were characterized by changes in density, pH, cell count, and concentrations of ethanol and organic acids. The prototypes were also evaluated on 26 sensory attributes, which were generated through a training session with 14 participants. While S. cerevisiae (IOCBF) underwent the fastest fermentation (8 days) and B. claussenii the slowest (21 days), K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae (Hornindal kveik) showed similar fermentation rates, finishing on day 20. The change in pH of the fermentate was similar for all five strains (from around 4.45 to between 4.25 and 4.31). Cell counts remained stable throughout the fermentation for all five strains (at around 6 log colony-forming units (CFU)/mL) except in the case of S. cerevisiae (Hornindal kveik), which ultimately decreased by 1.63 log CFU/mL. B. bruxellensis was the only strain unable to utilize all of the sugars in the substrate, with residual galactose remaining after fermentation. While both S. cerevisiae (IOCBF)-and B. claussenii-fermented samples were characterized by a fruity apple aroma, the former also had an aroma characteristic of lactic acid, dairy products, bakeries and yeast. A chemical odor characteristic of petroleum, gasoline or solvents, was perceived in samples fermented by B. bruxellensis and K. marxianus. An aroma of poorly aged or rancid cheese or milk also resulted from B. bruxellensis fermentation. In terms of appearance and mouthfeel, the S. cerevisiae (IOCBF)-fermented sample was rated the cloudiest, with the heaviest body. This study provides a toolkit for product development in a potential dairy-based category of fermented alcoholic beverages, which can increase revenue for the dairy industry by upcycling the common waste product YAW. © 2021 by the authors.","Acid whey; Dairy; Fermented beverage; Sustainability; Waste products",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107848620

Recent policymaking has focused on establishing principles for the trustworthy use of AI. Adhering to these principles is especially important for ensuring that the development and application of AI raises economic and social welfare, including among vulnerable groups and veterans. Objective: We explore the newly developed principles around trustworthy AI and how they can be readily applied at scale to vulnerable groups that are potentially less likely to benefit from technological advances. Methods: Using the US Department of Veterans Affairs as a case study, we explore the principles of trustworthy AI that are of particular interest for vulnerable groups and veterans. Results: We focus on three principles: (1) designing, developing, acquiring, and using AI so that the benefits of its use significantly outweigh the risks and the risks are assessed and managed; (2) ensuring that the application of AI occurs in well-defined domains and is accurate, effective, and fit for the intended purposes; and (3) ensuring that the operations and outcomes of AI applications are sufficiently interpretable and understandable by all subject matter experts, users, and others. Conclusions: These principles and applications apply more generally to vulnerable groups, and adherence to them can allow the VA and other organizations to continue modernizing their technology governance, leveraging the gains of AI while simultaneously managing its risks. © 2021 Christos Makridis, Seth Hurley, Mary Klote, Gil Alterovitz.","Artificial intelligence; Data; Ethics; Health data; Health technology; Technology; Veterans; Veterans Affairs",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107842553

In this study, melanin samples derived fromAmorphotheca resinaewere prepared, followed by the evaluation of their sunscreen performance, antioxidant activity, and cytotoxicity. Melanin-blended cream was prepared by blending a melanin suspension and a pure cream. The cream showed anin vitrosun protection factor value of 2.5 when the pigment content was 5%. The cream showed a critical wavelength of approximately 388 nm and a UVA/UVB ratio of more than 0.81, satisfying the broad-spectrum sunscreen requirement. Oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays indicated that fungal melanin had antioxidant activity similar to ascorbic acid but higher than reduced glutathione.

While sustainability is often claimed to be the desired outcome of AI applications, there is as yet little evidence on how AI contributes to the sustainable fishery. The purpose of this paper is to perform a systematic review of the literature on the smart fishery and to identify upcoming themes for future research on the sustainable fishery in the Age of AI. The findings of the review reveal that scholarly attention in AI-inspired fishery literature focuses mostly on automation of fishery resources monitoring, mainly detection, identification, and classification. Some papers list marine health and primary production which are vital dimensions for Large Marine Ecosystems to recycle nutrients to sustain anticipated production levels. Very few reviewed articles refer to assessing individual needs, particularly fishers, from AI deployment in fisheries and policy response from governments. We call for future AI for sustainable fishery studies on how fishers perceive AI needs, and how governments possess a tangible strategy or depth of understanding on the regulation of AI concerning smart fishery systems and research on resilience-enhancing policies to promote the value and potentials of the AI-inspired smart fishery in different locations. © 2021 by the authors.

However, to date, very few studies have investigated which digital technologies could enable the circular economy in the built environment. This study specifically focuses on the built environment as one of the largest, most energy- and material-intensive industries globally, and investigates the following question: which digital technologies potentially enable a circular economy in the built environment, and in what ways? The research uses an iterative stepwise method: (1) framework development based on regenerating, narrowing, slowing and closing resource loop principles; (2) expert workshops to understand the usage of digital technologies in a circular built environment; (3) a literature and practice review to further populate the emerging framework with relevant digital technologies; and (4) the final mapping of digital technologies onto the framework. This study develops a novel Circular Digital Built Environment framework. It identifies and maps ten enabling digital technologies to facilitate a circular economy in the built environment. These include: (1) additive/robotic manufacturing, (2) artificial intelligence, (3) big data and analytics, (4) blockchain technology, (5) building information modelling, (6) digital platforms/marketplaces, (7) digital twins, (8) the geographical information system, (9) material passports/databanks, and (10) the internet of things.

Despite the vast popularity of these models, their vulnerabilities remain unknown; this is of high concern given their growing use in security-sensitive applications such as question answering and machine translation in the aspects of sustainability. In this study, we demonstrate that NRE models are inherently vulnerable to adversarially crafted text that contains imperceptible modifications of the original but can mislead the target NRE model. Specifically, we propose a novel sustainable term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) based black-box adversarial attack to evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art CNN, CGN, LSTM, and BERT-based models on two benchmark RE datasets. Compared with white-box adversarial attacks, black-box attacks impose further constraints on the query budget; thus, efficient black-box attacks remain an open problem. By applying TFIDF to the correctly classified sentences of each class label in the test set, the proposed query-efficient method achieves a reduction of up to 70% in the number of queries to the target model for identifying important text items. Based on these items, we design both character-and word-level perturbations to generate adversarial examples. The proposed attack successfully reduces the accuracy of six representative models from an average F1 score of 80% to below 20%. The generated adversarial examples were evaluated by humans and are considered semantically similar. Moreover, we discuss defense strategies that mitigate such attacks, and the potential countermeasures that could be deployed in order to improve sustainability of the proposed scheme. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent studies show how social media and e-word of mouth (e-WoM) are playing key roles in the perception and image diffusion of tourist destinations. Thus, it is necessary to look for new methods for analyzing the tourist management and attractiveness of tourist spots. This includes conducting a sentiment analysis of tourists that modifies former research methods based on previously proposed model, supported by a survey, which obtained predefined and incomplete results. This study analyzed the quality of tourism in Spain, a major tourist destination that is considered to be the country with the greatest tourist competitiveness according to the World Economic Forum, and in China, the country with the greatest level of development and potential. A sentiment analysis was carried out to measure the quality of tourist destinations in Spain, and this involved three challenges: (1) the analysis of the sentiments of Chinese tourists obtained from e-WoM; (2) the use of new models to measure the quality of a destination based on information from Chinese social networks, and (3) the use of the latest artificial intelligence analytical technologies. Our findings demonstrate how sentiment analysis can be a determining factor in measuring WoM and identifying areas of development in tourist destinations in order to build a more sustainable destination. The results includes the following aspects: (1) the use of real images with more empirical evidence, (2) the use of impressive and disappointing sentiments, (3) a “no comment status”, (4) elimination of stereotypes, and (5) the identification of new opportunities and segments. © 2021 by the authors.

Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer’s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

Their perception is a critical factor in making decisions regarding the region’s competitiveness. Algarve’s two major and leading associations of the tourism supply sector AIHSA and AHETA were invited to participate in the study. Based on the responses of an online questionnaire, an artificial intelligence algorithm was applied to the data to identify the common and divergent aspects. The conceptual model developed is based on a simplified model of psychological ownership. The results highlight a convergent perspective regarding sustainability challenges, namely, natural resources and biodiversity, safety, and supply chain. However, hotels and restaurants do not reflect the same perception regarding sustainability initiatives, e-tourism, or free internet access. These divergences are essential results since they indicated which issues require local authorities’ priority intervention. © 2021 by the authors.

People’s living environment and the agricultural products they need are also affected by it. Frequent problems have seriously affected the sustainable development of the ecological environment. This article takes the central and western parts of a province as the survey object, uses the methods of geological accumulation index and comprehensive pollution index to analyze the soil pollution status of the survey area, and uses the index soil fertility index to evaluate the soil fertility in the fresh food production area. The AERMOD model was used to calculate the dry sedimentation, wet sedimentation, and total sedimentation of organic waste gas. In addition, in the era of big data, with the emergence and development of artificial intelligence technology, translation technology has developed rapidly and has become the new favorite of the translation industry, which has had an important impact on the translation industry. It also puts forward new requirements for the construction of the corpus. Constructing the ecology of soil environment prediction from the perspective of ecological translation is helpful to construct the connotation of interconnection, mutual restriction and interaction among system components. This thesis is guided by the theoretical thoughts of ecological translation, and tries to explore the advancement of soil environment prediction by constructing an ecological view of translation. Through the application of project management concepts in daily teaching, it can help a student to better master the process and methods of translation and improve their translation ability. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Corpus; Machine learning; Soil environment prediction; Translation teaching","geoaccumulation index; machine learning; prediction; project management; sedimentation; soil fertility; soil pollution; teaching; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107350405

Membrane technologies satisfy all the principles of sustainability due to their advantages, such as cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, absence of additional reagents and ease of use compared to traditional separation methods. In the present work, novel green membranes based on sodium alginate (SA) modified by a FeBTC metal–organic framework were developed for isopropanol dehydration using a membrane process, pervaporation. Two kinds of SA-FeBTC membranes were developed: (1) untreated membranes and (2) cross-linked membranes with citric acid or phosphoric acid. The structural and physicochemical properties of the developed SA-FeBTC membranes were studied by spectroscopic techniques (FTIR and NMR), microscopic methods (SEM and AFM), thermogravimetric analysis and swelling experiments. The transport properties of developed SA-FeBTC membranes were studied in the pervaporation of water–isopropanol mixtures. Based on membrane transport properties, 15 wt % FeBTC was demonstrated to be the optimal content of the modifier in the SA matrix for the membrane performance. A membrane based on SA modified by 15 wt % FeBTC and cross-linked with citric acid possessed optimal transport properties for the pervaporation of the water–isopropanol mixture (12–100 wt % water): 174–1584 g/(m2 h) permeation flux and 99.99 wt % water content in the permeate. © 2021 by the authors.

Big Data and AI systems have enabled the implementation of the Digital Twin paradigm (introduced first in the manufacturing sector) in all the sectors of society. DEs promise to be a flexible and operative framework that allow the development of local, national, and international Digital Twins. In particular, the “Digital Twins of the Earth” may generate the actionable intelligence that is necessary to address global change challenges, facilitate the European Green transition, and contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. The case of the Destination Earth initiative and system is discussed in the manuscript as an example to address the broader DE concepts. In respect to the more traditional data and information infrastructural philosophy, DE solutions present important advantages as to flexibility and viability. However, designing and implementing an effective collaborative DE is far more difficult than a traditional digital system. DEs require the definition and the governance of a metasystemic level, which is not necessary for a traditional information system. The manuscript discusses the principles, patterns, and architectural viewpoints characterizing a thriving DE supporting the generation and operation of “Digital Twins of the Earth”. The conclusions present a set of conditions, best practices, and base capabilities for building a knowledge framework, which makes use of the Digital Twin paradigm and the DE approach to support decision makers with the SDG agenda implementation. © 2021 by the authors.","Digital ecosystem; Digital twins; Earth observation; Green deal data space; Interoperability science Paolo Tarolli; Metasystems; Remote sensing; SDGs; System-of-systems engineering","Decision making; Ecosystems; Online systems; Architectural viewpoints; Data and information; Decision makers; Digital ecosystem; Green transitions; Key characteristics; Knowledge frameworks; Manufacturing sector; Digital twin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107334000

The 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals (SDGs) was ratified in 2015 as a continuation of the millennium development goals (MDGs). In this sense, the SDGs, as MDGs were in their day, are a global mechanism that urges governments to coordinate to address global problems. At the core of the SDGs is 'to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.' The SDGs consist in a series of 17 goals with 169 targets which, for the first time, identify the fight against poverty as a necessity for sustainable development. The SDGs consider the ecological, social, and economic dimensions as interdependent for sustainable development. With the progress and advances of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, many researchers are exploring the possibility of their use to tackle societal problems. This is what many people nowadays call 'AI for social good' (AI4SG). The concept behind AI4SG is very simple: AI-powered systems and capabilities applied to improve public welfare [1]. Although there are different forms of classification of AI4SG initiatives (in terms of data, modeling, or decision-making) 'projects addressing AI4SG vary significantly' [2] and the AI behind these projects may have been designed for the 'good' but, in practice, it could end up going 'bad.' More importantly, not everyone would agree on what is a good result. The main motivation for any application of the AI4SG is to solve social problems. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",,"Behavioral research; Climate change; Decision making; Planning; Sustainable development; Artificial intelligence technologies; Global mechanisms; Global problems; Global scale; Millennium development goals; Public welfare; Social problems; Societal problems; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107329376

Therefore, this study sought to investigate the influence of artificial intelligence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals with a direct focus on poverty reduction, goal one, industry, innovation, and infrastructure development goal 9, in emerging economies. Using content analysis, the result pointed to the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong influence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals particularly on poverty reduction, improvement of the certainty and reliability of infrastructure like transport making economic growth and development possible in emerging economies. The results revealed that Artificial intelligence is making poverty reduction possible through improving the collection of poverty-related data through poverty maps, revolutionizing agriculture education and the finance sector through financial inclusion. The study also discovered that AI is also assisting a lot in education, and the financial sector allowing the previously excluded individuals to be able to participate in the mainstream economy. Therefore, it is important that governments in emerging economies need to invest more in the use of AI and increase the research related to it so that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to innovation, infrastructure development, poverty reduction are attained. © 2021 by the author.

Automating crop classification process while elaborating a workflow is a key step for reliable and precise crop mapping. This study aims to develop an approach for crop classification in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, following the specific goals of i) evaluating spatial satellite-based features to guide crop data collection; ii) testing transfer learning model with subsequent growing season data; iii) examining accuracy in early-season prediction model; and lastly, iv) developing a crop classification model for estimating large scale crop area. As main data inputs, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation data were used to extract features to input in the Random Forest classifier. Spatial variability of satellite features was evaluated using Moran's I Index and cluster k-means. Crop area prediction data were obtained at municipality level to compare with census data (standard method). A crop summer map layer was generated for three major crops: soybeans (Glycine max L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The crop classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.95. Model performance was influenced by sample size and spatial variability of the samples. The random forest model was transferred to the next growing season with 0.89 and 0.91 overall accuracy for 250 and 750 samples, respectively. However, overall accuracy increased from 0.93 to 0.95 when 50 to 250 samples of same-year data was aggregated to the model. Similar accuracy was obtained for predictions done with data until March relative to when the entire season was considered, until May. When data for more growing seasons were aggregated, the model produced more accurate early season predictions (January and February). Soybean prediction area obtained the highest performance (R2 = 0.94), relative to rice (R2 = 0.90) and corn (R2 = 0.37). The rice prediction area presented a high precision, but the crop area was overestimated due to errors with wetland target relative to other class.

Initially, two different chromatographic columns coupled with five chromatographic factors were screened employing a Fractional Factorial Design. Once the phenyl-hexyl column was chosen and the most important factors were known, they were optimized in a Central Composite Design (CCD). Outcomes were monitored using two multiparametric responses: Green Chromatographic Fingerprinting Response (GCFR) with modifications and HPLC-EAT (Environmental Assessment Tool), and Derringer's desirability function was employed to reach a trade-off between them. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) strategy enabled the prediction of the optimized chromatographic conditions as 5.26–52.63 % of the food grade bioethanol (95 °GL) in 30 min, at 35 °C, and 0.6 mL min−1. The simultaneous consideration of environmental and separation parameters led to the successful development of a validated HPLC-PAD method more efficient, cheaper, and almost 3-fold greener when compared with a preliminary reference method reported in the literature, also being applicable even by small laboratories without cutting-edge instrumentation. © 2021 Phytochemical Society of Europe","Derringer's desirability function; Green analytical chemistry; Green liquid chromatography; Herbal fingerprint; Response surface methodology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105042698

ST is also the key factor in sustainable agricultural developments, so researchers are still motivated to develop robust machine learning (ML) models to predict ST more reliably. Four different ML models, utilizing the standalone algorithms (i.e., artificial neural networks: ‘ANN’ and co-active neuro-fuzzy inference systems: ‘CANFIS’) and complementary algorithms (i.e., wavelet transformation combined with ANN: ‘WANN’ and wavelet transformation combined with CANFIS: ‘WCANFIS’) were developed to predict the ST at six meteorological stations incorporating a wide range of climatic features to improve the overall performance. The study has utilized data over the period 2000–2010, collected at 12 locations in Iran. In the first phase of this research, the effects of climate variability on the changes in ST at different depths (i.e., 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 and 100 cm) were explored using air temperature as the exploratory and ST as the response variable. Assessing the performance of the predictive models used in ST prediction, the results indicated good predictive capability of the WCANFIS model, thus, advocating its potential utility in ST prediction problems, especially over diverse climatic regions. This study has also ascertained that the minimum and the maximum predictive errors were encountered at a depth of about 20 cm and 100 cm, respectively. The assessment of climatic features based on air temperature datasets on the performance of the models indicated the highest efficacy demonstrated by the ANN model for the case A–C–W climate type (i.e., a moist climate regime: Arid, temperature regime in winter: Cool, and temperature regime in summer: Warm), in comparison with the PH–C–W climate type (moist regime: Per-humid) for the other best ML models (i.e., WANN, WCANFIS and CANFIS). The order of the model accuracies based on the root mean square error (RMSE) can be ranked with error values of as: WCANFIS = 0.43 °C, ANN = 0.69 °C, CANFIS = 2.16 °C and WANN = 2.31 °C, demonstrating the wavelet-based CANFIS model to exceed the performance of the counterpart comparative models. The present study provides evidence of successfully developing new ML models, improved through wavelet transform for effective feature extraction, and the importance of such hybrid models that have practical implications in studying soil temperature based on air temperature feature inputs in diverse climatic conditions. The outcomes of this study are expected to support key decisions in sustainable agriculture and other related areas where soil health, based on air temperature changes, needs to be monitored or predicted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural sustainability; Air temperature; Artificial neural networks; Co-active neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Machine learning; Soil temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Bayesian networks; Catchments; Climate models; Errors; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Machine learning; Markov processes; Mean square error; Soils; Agricultural sustainability; Air temperature; Climatic conditions; Co-active neuro-fuzzy inference system; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Performance; Soil temperature; Wavelet transformations; Agriculture; air temperature; alternative agriculture; artificial neural network; climate change; climate conditions; machine learning; model; modeling; soil temperature; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104821500

This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Digital technologies; Port logistics; Smart logistics; Sustainable logistics","Aircraft detection; Data Analytics; Drones; Economics; Environmental technology; Monitoring; Real time systems; Smart city; Sustainable development; Waste management; Digital technologies; Global context; Logistics process; Policy makers; Port authorities; Port city; Ports logistics; Shipping companies; Smart logistic; Sustainable logistic; Ships",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104756448

Fortunately, new digital technology provides tools to more effectively address the growing dual burden of disease. Two-thirds of the world's population subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2018, while the falling price of connectivity and the 5G networks rollout promise to accelerate the use of digital technology. Properly leveraged, we can employ digital solutions and applications to transform health systems from reactive to proactive and even preventive, helping people stay healthy. With artificial intelligence (AI), health systems can be made more predictive by detecting risk factors and helping health professionals respond faster to prevent disease. Yet this rapid pace of growth has also complicated the digital health landscape. Myriad digital health apps compete and overlap in the public and private sectors, and significant gaps in the collection and analysis of digital data threaten to leave some behind. Established in 2010, the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development is led by ITU and UNESCO and advocates for the transformational impact of broadband technologies for development. Its working group on digital and AI in health, co-chaired by the Novartis Foundation and at different times Nokia, Intel and Microsoft, identifies best practices for countries to realize the potential of digital technology in health and care. Interviewing more than 100 key stakeholders and reviewing over 200 documents, the Working Group set out to identify common challenges that countries face in implementing digital health solutions, and to develop a framework that countries can use to build systems for supporting digital health solutions. Common challenges include a lack of coordination leading to fragmented digital health solutions; lack of systems and workforce capacity to manage data and digital technology, and inadequate financing to support digital health. The working group proposes six building blocks for digital health systems: formulate and execute a national digital health strategy; create policy and regulatory frameworks that support innovation while protecting security and privacy; ensure access to digital infrastructure; ensure interoperability of digital health system components; establish effective partnerships; and sustain adequate financing. © 2021","Digital technology; Health systems; Intersectoral collaboration; Noncommunicable diseases; Sustainable Development Goals","Artificial intelligence; Health; Health risks; Information management; Interoperability; Broadband technologies; Digital infrastructures; Health professionals; Low and middle income countries; Public and private sector; Regulatory frameworks; Security and privacy; Transformational impacts; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104593451

Low-cost biosand filters (BSF) have been widely adopted in over 180 countries worldwide. However, they produce inconsistent flow rates and have a lower removal efficacy for Escherichia coli and turbidity during the first 4 weeks of use. Their improvement in terms of filtration rate, microbial and turbidity removal has been a new facet of this area of the study. A 3-month longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate the performance of a modified biosand filter (MBSF) in terms of flow rates in addition to removal of turbidity, and waterborne pathogens (E coli, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia) from drinking water by the addition of 5 cm silver embedded clay granules and a diffusion disk between the layers of sand. The mean physicochemical parameters of surface water used as feed for the filters were as follows: pH (7.1), temperature (28 °C), turbidity 112 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), E. coli (log10 4.8 CFU/100 mL), C. parvum (11 oocysts/mL) and G. lamblia (32 cysts/mL). Results revealed a notable difference between the two filters in terms of turbidity removal; ranging between (51–92 %) and (98.6–98.8 %) for the BSF and MBSF, respectively. An addition of a diffusion plate between the layers resulted in an increased flow rate from 18.2 to 38.7 L/hour.

Novel AI application techniques such as the artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms and expert systems have gained popularity in the fourth industrial revolution era. Due to the chemical composition, inherent complexity, incoherent flow rate and higher safety factor in the effective operation of the biological wastewater treatment process, the AI-based model was extensively tested in managing the wastewater treatment operations. The interrelationship between COD and trace metals was studied using an AI-based prediction model with ANNs incorporated in MATLAB. A supervised learning algorithm was used for training the ANNs and to relate input data to output data. The training was aimed at estimating, validating, predicting the parameters by an error function minimization. The goodness of the prediction was attained with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.98–0.99, a sum of square error (SSE) 0.00029–0.1598, room mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0049–0.8673, mean squared error (MSE) 2.7059e-14 to 2.3175e-15. The ANNs models were found to be a robust tool for predicting WWTP performance. The predictive approaches can be used in the prediction of environmental management and other emerging technologies.

One of the many problems associated with these landfills is the formation of leachate. Because of its complexity and unpredictable composition, leachate has always constituted a challenging task for effluent managers. Despite the countless techniques that have been developed since then, leachate treatment still raises big concerns about the efficiency and sustainability of a suitable strategy. Accordingly, this study is carried out aiming at the optimization of leachate treatment through biostimulation using carob powder as a co-substrate. The added amount of biostimulant corresponds approximately to the addition of 3, 1, and 0.4 g/L of sucrose, fructose, and glucose, respectively. The adopted experimental system is based on the anaerobic process using an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, which was operated at HRT and OLR of 24 h and 26.1 kg COD/m3 d, respectively. For carob particle size larger than 2 mm, only a small amount of biogas was produced and the COD removal efficiency was lower than 77%, indicating that the poor quality of the effluent persists. However, 97% of COD was efficiently removed and a volume of 2.06 L/Lleachate of biogas was produced using a carob particle size of 0.250 mm. The obtained results showed also that the amount of produced biogas increases as the carob sugar content increases. Literally, a 1% fraction of total sugar content resulted in an increase of 17.9 mL/Lleahate of the produced biogas. Finally, the use of 10 g/L of carob amendment improved COD removal and exhibited less influence on syntrophs and methanogens since a large amount of biogas was generated. © 2021, University of Tehran.","Biogas production; Biostimulaion; Carob powder; Leachate treatment; Methanogens; UASB reactor","anaerobic digestion; biogas; bioreactor; biostimulation; chemical oxygen demand; developing world; domestic waste; landfill; leachate; microorganism; optimization; waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103591465

The conventional traffic control systems with inefficient human resources management fail to control the traffic discipline, leading to increased traffic density and road offenses. However, the intelligent transportation system (ITS) can provide safety, efficiency, and sustainability for large-scale vehicular traffic dilemmas. ITS unites machine learning with the available traffic control force and performs real-time police scheduling to ensure the smooth flow of traffic. Many researchers have demonstrated notable work in intelligent traffic police scheduling and deployment using various optimization algorithms. However, the compilation of such praiseworthy work as a whole is still missing. Motivated by these facts, we provide a comprehensive review of the machine learning-based state-of-the-art technologies that can be used to form a three-tier solution taxonomy. The first tier describes various tools and technologies that can be utilized to collect traffic data. The second tier highlights the machine learning algorithms and their accuracy, which forms a pattern in the collected data and then yields some crucial information about traffic flow, congestion levels, and so forth. In the third tier, the most vital taxonomy layer, various traffic police scheduling strategies are discussed. The proposed survey also presents the use of cases of traffic police scheduling that elaborates this review's applicability in various domains.

Such analyses and future predictions are imperative to allow decision-makers and stakeholders to accomplish climate-resilient and sustainable development goals by leveraging the power of meaningful and trustworthy projections and insights. We demonstrated that the XAI is capable of predicting the Ec under future climate scenarios with high accuracy (R2&gt;0.9) and reveals the critical inflection points of the daily average outdoor air temperature (Ta) beyond which the Ec increase exponentially. We applied the XAI model for residential and commercial buildings in hot–humid and mixed–humid climate regions to quantify the incremental impacts of climate change on Ec under the different SSPs. The XAI-based analysis concluded positive and persistent incremental changes in the Ec from 2020 to 2100 under all future SSP scenarios, with the maximum incremental impact of 24.5%, 33.3%, 57.8%, and 87.2% in hot–humid and 37.1%, 47.5%, 85.3%, and 121% in mixed–humid climate regions under the sustainable green energy (SSP126), business-as-usual (SSP245), challenges to adaptation (SSP370), and increased reliance on fossil fuels (SSP585) scenarios, respectively.

First, a natural language processing technique from a specific data mining application field is adopted to mine public preference information. Then, experts are clustered and subgroup leaders are selected. Next, a consensus reaching model is proposed to reduce the discrepancies among experts.

Restaurant meal delivery (RMD) is studied as an example to demonstrate how the preferred method and local impacts of delivery vehicle trips may vary by neighborhood characteristics (e.g., restaurant density and service areas, customer demand, and delivery driver availability). Instead of seeking route optimization solutions, this study developed a generic model to estimate the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per meal order for three generalized types of neighborhoods and six delivery scenarios that involve one or more strategies: (1) chaining customers; (2) chaining restaurants; (3) customers picking up orders at a designated location (instead of door-to-door services); and (4) crowdsourcing drivers. The results from the model implementation in Chicago showed that alternative delivery strategies can reduce the VMT per order from one-to-one RMD by 16.1% to 61.1%, and the reduction effects of these strategies are varied by neighborhood. Great reductions in VMT per order could be achieved when the delivery time was extended (e.g., from 45 to up to 90 min). Accordingly, this study recommended neighborhood-specific policies for delivery services (e.g., chaining orders in areas with clustered restaurants offering small service zones and crowdsourcing drivers in areas with clustered restaurants offering large service zones), incentivizing socially preferable strategies (e.g., subsidizing customers willing to accommodate longer delivery time), and the public sector's role in coordinating among service providers for neighborhood-conscious services. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Continuous approximation; Demand-responsive models; Restaurant meal delivery; Sustainability impacts; Urban delivery services; Urban transportation policy","Crowdsourcing; Door to door service (freight); Reduction; Sales; Urban transportation; Delivery service; Model implementation; Neighborhood characteristics; Reduction effects; Route optimization; Traffic impact analysis; Transportation impacts; Vehicle-miles traveled; Service industry; crowdsourcing; neighborhood; public goods; service provision; sustainability; traffic management; transportation policy; urban transport; Chicago; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102385654

However, due to technological constraints, it is difficult to provide simultaneously high spatial resolution, high temporal frequency, and high quality observation data. Existing mapping solutions are limited by traditional remotely sensed data, that have shorter observation periods, poor spatio-temporal consistency and comparability. Therefore, a new mapping paradigm is needed. This paper develops a framework for intelligent mapping (iMap) of land cover based on state-of-the-art technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual constellations, and spatio-temporal reconstruction and fusion. Under this framework, we built an automated, serverless, end-to-end data production chain and parallel mapping system based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and produced the first 30 m global daily seamless data cubes (SDC), and annual to seasonal land cover maps for 1985–2020. The SDC was produced through a multi-source spatio-temporal data reconstruction and fusion workflow based on Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR virtual constellations. Independent validation results show that the relative mean error of the SDC is less than 2.14%. As analysis ready data (ARD), it can lay a foundation for high-precision quantitative remote sensing information extraction. From this SDC, we produced 36-year long, 30 m resolution global land cover map data set by combining strategies of sample migration, machine learning, and spatio-temporal adjustment. The average overall accuracy of our annual land cover maps over multiple periods of time is 80% for level 1 classification and over 73% for level 2 classification (29 and 33 classes). Based on an objective validation sample consisting of FLUXNET sites, our map accuracy is 10% higher than that of existing global land cover datasets including Globeland30. Our results show that the average global land cover change rate is 0.36%/yr. Global forest decreased by 1.47 million km2 from 38.44 million km2, cropland increased by 0.84 million km2 from 12.49 million km2 and impervious surface increased by 0.48 million km2 from 0.57 million km2 during 1985– 2020. © 2021 The Author(s)","Amazon web Services; Analysis ready data; Cloud computing; Daily; Global land cover mapping; Intelligent mapping; Seamless data cube","Biodiversity; Classification (of information); Conservation; Food supply; Geometry; Information management; Learning systems; Mapping; Remote sensing; Web services; Websites; Amazon web services; Analyse ready data; Cloud-computing; Daily; Data cube; Global land cover mapping; Intelligent mapping; Land cover maps; Land-cover change; Seamless data cube; Cloud computing; accuracy assessment; AVHRR; biodiversity; conservation planning; conservation status; land cover; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102248115

The research study also carried out by using a total of 199, in which 139 (70%) and 60 (30%) gully head-cut points were used for training and validation purposes respectively and treated as dependent factors, and twenty gully erosion conditioning factors as independent variables. These models are validated through receiver operating characteristics-area under the curve (ROC-AUC), accuracy (ACC), precision (PRE) and Kappa coefficient index analysis. The validation result showed that EBO model with the highest values of AUC-0.954, ACC-0.85, PRE-0.877 and Kappa-0.646 is the most accurate model for GES followed by BRT and RF. The outcome results should help for the sustainable development of this rugged badland topography. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Badland topography; EBO; Ex-situ tree species; Land degradation; Sustainable development","rain; accuracy assessment; algorithm; control system; gully erosion; model validation; optimization; precision; topography; Article; catchment area; controlled study; cropland; environmental planning; forest; geographic elevation; geography; geology; geomorphology; gully; India; land use; landscape; learning algorithm; machine learning; measurement accuracy; plant; prediction; process optimization; random forest; regression analysis; river; soil erosion; soil texture; species; stream (river); surface runoff; sustainable development; topography; urban area; vegetation; environmental protection; geographic information system; soil; India; Conservation of Natural Resources; Geographic Information Systems; India; Machine Learning; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102152370

Accurate, finely detailed cartographic representations of hydrologic streamlines are critically important in various scientific domains, such as assessing the quantity and quality of present and future water resources, modeling climate changes, evaluating agricultural suitability, mapping flood inundation, and monitoring environmental changes. Conventional approaches to detecting such streamlines cannot adequately incorporate information from the complex three-dimensional (3D) environment of streams and land surface features. Such information is vital to accurately delineate streamlines. In recent years, high accuracy lidar data has become increasingly available for deriving both 3D information and terrestrial surface reflectance. This study develops an attention U-net model to take advantage of high-accuracy lidar data for finely detailed streamline detection and evaluates model results against a baseline of multiple traditional machine learning methods. The evaluation shows that the attention U-net model outperforms the best baseline machine learning method by an average F1 score of 11.25% and achieves significantly better smoothness and connectivity between classified streamline channels. These findings suggest that our deep learning approach can harness high-accuracy lidar data for fine-scale hydrologic streamline detection, and in turn produce desirable benefits for many scientific domains. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CyberGIS; Deep learning; Hydrography; Hydrologic streamlines; Lidar data analysis","Climate change; Deep learning; Flood control; Floods; Surface waters; Sustainable development; Cybergis; Deep learning; Fine-scale; High-accuracy; Human survival; Hydrologic streamline; LIDAR data; Lidar data analyse; Machine learning methods; Net model; Optical radar; climate change; detection method; hydrological modeling; land surface; machine learning; surface water; water relations; water resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102146977

However, extended analysis time and consumption of toxic organic solvents, associated with traditional columns, remain the main stumbling blocks of such methods’ sustainability. A new green chiral HPLC-separation, with just 0.45 mL ethanol in mobile phase per run utilizing a 50-mm column as a stationary phase, achieves a significant determination of alfuzosin (ALF) enantiomers along with solifenacin (SOL) simultaneously. Enantioseparation of ALF was firstly evaluated in the reversed-phase mode using five polysaccharide-based Lux columns (Amylose 2 and Cellulose 1–4), highlighting Lux Cellulose 2 to reach the best enantioselectivity. Central composite design with Derringer's desirability function was then adopted to optimize the chromatographic conditions for an acceptable resolution. A mobile phase composed of ethanol and phosphate buffer, pH 4, (30:70, v/v) at a rate of 0.5 mL/min with UV-detection at 215 nm, exhibits good separation of ALF-enantiomers from SOL with resolution values of 1.45 and 2.64, respectively. The method's greenness profile has been assessed and compared with that of mostly reported ones via the newest comprehensive analytical method greenness score (AMGS) calculator. The proposed method is considered a straightforward approach towards safer, more economic, eco-friendly and comparatively favorable for the cited drugs’ quantification in their formulation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Alfuzosin enantiomers; Chiral separation; Experimental design; Green chemistry; Solifenacin",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101554363

The hydraulic pressure in pipes is an influential factor for the occurrence of pipe breaks. However, little evidence has been provided so far for the quantitative assessment of the impact of pressure control on reducing the number of pipe breaks. In this paper, we applied logistic regression with polynomial terms, and a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of pressure control on reducing pipe breaks. A large dataset of historic pipe breaks was used to develop and validate the presented method. Cast iron and asbestos cement pipes were examined in detail. Results showed that pipe breaks could be decreased by 18% to 30% by reducing the mean pressure for the investigated cohorts of asbestos cement and cast iron pipes. Pressure range reduction could provide larger impacts on both pipe materials. These results indicate that proactively controlling the hydraulic pressure may have a potentially significant impact on the reliability and sustainability of water supply networks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Logistic regression; Machine learning; Pipe breaks; Pressure control; Water supply networks management","Asbestos; Asbestos cement; Cast iron; Cast iron pipe; Deterioration; Hydraulic fluids; Large dataset; Logistic regression; Polynomial regression; Potable water; Sensitivity analysis; Water supply; Hydraulic pressure; Influential factors; Mean pressures; Pipe material; Potential impacts; Pressure ranges; Quantitative assessments; Water supply networks; Pressure control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100980597

Such a requirement arises from the need for device-hop based networking to eliminate a dedicated end-to-end physical network for pervasive communication and promotes local data and computation sharing mechanisms as well as sustainably utilising the ubiquitous mobility aspect of such applications in the contemporary times. However, the functionality of opportunism runs into its own set of impasse; intermittent connectivity, limited resources, need for intelligence in routing, to name a few. Leveraging the ability of ML to tailor represent features to our advantage, this paper proposes a scheme to sectionalize the network topology based on node characteristics and employ grouping in intelligent transmission. The proposed scheme HiLSeR enables message routing using a combination of controlled-parameterized flooding and opportunistic sector-based decentralized transmission. Hierarchical learning, a multi-dimensional data conduct based soft clustering paradigm, is used for topology sectionalization and routing decision making. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated against contemporaneous RLPRoPH, GMMR, KNNR and Firefly PRoPHET protocols with ONE based simulations. The performance and sustainability performance is compared on various parameters such as Energy Unit per message, Dead node Percentage, Overhead Ratio, Average Latency and Success Ratio to show the enhanced performance. HiLSeR has an average successful delivery rate of 0.911 averaging out at 0.86775, in comparison to RLPRoPH, GMMR, KNNR, Firefly PRoPHET, the proposed scheme performs 12.85 %, 5.59 %, 61.29 %, 18.50 % and 88.33 % better respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Context-Aware; Energy efficiency; Hierarchical clustering; Internet of things; Machine learning; Mobile intelligence; Networks; Opportunistic networks; Pervasive communication; Sustainable computing","Bioluminescence; Decision making; Deep learning; Hierarchical clustering; Network routing; Topology; Computation sharing; Hierarchical learning; Intermittent connectivity; Multidimensional data; Pervasive communications; Resource efficiencies; Routing decisions; Sustainability performance; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099624489

Smart mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of city transport facilities and sustainable mobility within the urban environment. People need to travel quickly and conveniently between locations at different scales, ranging from a few blocks within a city to a journey across cities. At the same time, goods need to be timely delivered, considering both the users and the businesses' needs. Several cities indicated an interest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) for the 'last-mile' mobility services in the last few years. With them, it seems to be easier to get people and goods around using fewer vehicles. In this context, Autonomous Shuttles (AS) are beginning to be thought of as a new mobility/delivery service into the city center where narrow streets are not easily served by traditional buses. They allow them to perform critical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reduce noise and pollution. The article analyses the state-of-art on autonomous shuttles by proposing four application scenarios targeting the last-mile delivery of goods, the tourist experiences, and the shared and integrated mobility. Furthermore, we contribute with the proposition of the Autonomous Shuttles-as-a service (ASaaS) concept as the key pillar for the realization of innovative and sustainable proximity mobility. Our research proposed new research challenges for ASaaS, and we discuss social implications and governance challenges that consider user engagement and sustainability. It also recommended extending new research to focus on simulation and machine learning techniques for last-mile mobility planning and explore the journeys tracking certification via artificial intelligence and blockchain-based techniques. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","autonomous shuttles; last mile delivery; mobility services; proximity mobility; Smart mobility","Artificial intelligence; Contracts; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Application scenario; Delivery of goods; Machine learning techniques; Research challenges; Social implication; Sociotechnical systems; Sustainable mobility; Urban environments; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097017596

The study also validated the drivers and challenges of precision agriculture by comparing extant literature with social media data. By mining online data from January 2010 to December 2019, this research captured over 40,000 posts discussing a myriad of concerns related to the practice. An analysis of these posts uncovered joy as the most predominant emotion, also reflected the prevalence of positive sentiments. Robust regulatory and institutional policies that promote both national and international agenda for PA adoption, and the potential of agricultural technology adoption to result in net-positive job creation were identified as the most prevalent drivers.

Phytoecdysteroids are an active compound found in certain plants, for example amaranthus, that are analogous to the moulting hormone in crustaceans. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of phytoecdysteroid administration through injection and artificial feed on moulting and growth of mud crabs (Scylla olivacea). Mud crabs with carapace width 61-62 mm and weight 50-51 g were reared in individual crab boxes with dimensions 25 20 20 cm. The selected crabs were injected with amaranthus extract at a dose of 1 mL/crab (I), then placed in the crab boxes and kept in a pond. Amaranthus leaves were dried in an oven at 60 C for 24 hours, ground using a hammer mill, and mixed with other feed ingredients. Different doses of amaranthus flour were applied: 0% (control), 10%. 12.5%, 15%, 17.5% and 20%. Moulting and growth data were analysed for a variance. The results showed that the administration of phytoecdysteroids from amaranthus by injection and through artificial feed had no effect on the percentage of mud crabs moulting, survival rate, growth, and feed conversion value. The mud crabs were not able to take full advantage of the artificial feed provided because of the inappropriate size of the feed and the fragile structure that cause wasted and uneaten feed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Grinding mills; Planning; Plants (botany); Sustainable development; Active compounds; Amaranthus; Carapace widths; Feed ingredients; Growth data; Hammermills; Survival rate; Shellfish",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107890245

High nutritional quality has an impact on increasing feed prices, so it is necessary to improve the quality of feed while maintaining a stable price. This study evaluated the organoleptic, physical and chemical quality of mud crab feed fermented by adding various doses of mixed microorganisms which cause fermentation to the raw feed materials. The microorganism mixture doses tested were: 0, 10, 20, and 30 mL 100 g-1 of raw feed materials.

Like other zooplankton, Tintinnopsis holds important roles in the food chain. An investigation on the zooplankton community focusing on species composition had been conducted in July 2020 in Polong River estuary, Pangkajene District, South Sulawesi. Sampling was carried out at four stations, each with three replications. Seventy-five liters of seawater were filtered using a plankton net 25 (0.06 mm) into a 100 mL sample bottle and added with 2mL of 1% Lugol. Zooplankton species were counted and identified by putting 1ml of water sample on a Sedgwick Rafter counter and observed on a microscope. Zooplankton identification followed Identification of Marine Plankton and Marine Plankton A Practical Guide. The number of zooplankton differences amongst stations was analyzed statistically by using a one-way ANOVA. Results showed that Tintinnopsis were found in all stations, and were most abundant in station 2, followed by stations 1, 3, and 4. There were two other zooplankton species found in the area, i.e. nauplii Copepoda (stations 1, 3, and 4) and Apocyclops sp (station 2). Each species composition was 80.60%, 18.62% and 0.78% for Tintinnopsis sp., nauplii copepods and Apocyclops sp., respectively.

Prebiotics are fibers that the body cannot digest and become food for probiotics. This study aimed to analyze the bacterial population, enzyme activity and feed conversion ratio of milkfish after being given various prebiotics from legumes in the feed. Milkfish measuring 4.13 2.75 g are reared in a glass aquarium measuring 50 45 45 cm filled with water with a salinity of 15-20 ppt. Fish are maintained at a density of 15 individuals/aquarium for 60 days and are fed 5% body weight/day. The study was designed in a completely randomized design with 5 prebiotic treatments of soybeans, peanuts, green beans, kidney beans, and control. The results showed that the treatment had a significant effect (p <0.05) on the bacterial population, as well as the protease and amylase enzyme activity, but not on FCR. The highest bacterial population was red bean prebiotics (2,082 103 CFU/mL), followed by green beans (2,001 103 CFU/mL), soybeans (972 103 CFU/mL). The highest activity (0.243 u/mL) and amylase enzyme (0.745 u/mL) was the prebiotic kidney beans, followed by soybeans (0.236 u/mL) amylase enzyme (0.506 u/mL), peanuts, protease enzymes (0.129 u/mL) amylase enzyme (0.554 u/mL) and green bean protease enzyme (0.156 u/mL) amylase enzyme (0.543 u/mL). Meanwhile, the FCR ranges from 1.43 .0.85 to 2.87 .1.70.

In this study, the effect of the thermal pretreatment method (60, 80, 100, 120 and 140 ºC) on dewatered sludge (DS) as substrate for electrogenic bacteria (EB) in ML-MFC was optimized using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method. The treated sludge then was used in ML-MFC by exposing them to the constant incubation temperature (35 ºC) with constant parameter of pH (6), initial moisture content (30 % vol/wt) and electrodes distance (3 cm) for 7 days incubation period. The performance of ML-MFC was relied on generation of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), power generation and EB biomass. Results shows the thermal pretreatment at 80 ºC was the optimum condition as the DS degradation rate (increment 78 %) when DS was treated for 4 h time treatment prior used in the ML-MFC. The degradation of DS was further degraded in ML-MFC via bio-catalysis process (51 % of SCOD produced compared initial DS inserted in MFCs ≈ 66 % SCOD removal). It was important to have a high DS degradation as the EB in ML-MFC would obtain more ‘food’ to growth thus increased the voltage (239 mV) and power density (98.34 mW/m2) generation. In comparison, the control ML-MFC recorded low performance of DS degradation rate (21 %), voltage (24 mV) and power density 0.88 mW/m2. Thus, by combining the pretreatment method of dewatered sludge prior used in ML-MFC it could improve the performance and expanding the application of ML-MFC as future renewable technology for sustainability of power sources.

Manual BC are still most frequently used in resource-limited settings. Data on automated BC performance in Africa are scarce. We implemented automated BC at a surveillance site of the African Network for improved Diagnostics, Epidemiology and Management of Common Infectious Agents (ANDEMIA). Methods: Between June 2017 and January 2018, pairs of automated BC (BacT/ALERT®FA Plus) and manual BC (brain-heart infusion broth) were compared at a University hospital in Bouaké, Côte d'Ivoire. BC were inoculated each with a target blood volume of 10 ml from the same venipuncture. Automated BC were incubated for up to 5 days, manual BC for up to 10 days. Terminal subcultures were performed for manual BC only. The two systems were compared regarding yield, contamination, and turnaround time. For quality assurance, isolates were retested in a German routine microbiological laboratory. Results: BC sampling was increased from on average 24 BC to 63 BC per month. A total of 337 matched pairs of BC were included. Automated BC was positive in 36.5%, manual BC in 24.0% (p-value &lt; 0.01), proportion of contamination was 47.9 and 43.8%, respectively (p-value = 1.0). Turnaround time of positive BC was shortened by 2.5 days with automated compared to manual BC (p &lt; 0.01). Most common detected pathogens in both systems were Klebsiella spp. (26.0%) and Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%). Most contaminants were members of the skin flora. Retesting of 162 isolates was concordant in 79.6% on family level. Conclusions: Implementing automated BC in a resource-limited setting is possible and improves microbiological diagnostic performance. Automated BC increased yield and shortened turnaround times. Regular training and mentorship of clinicians has to be intensified to increase number and quality of BC. Pre-analytical training to improve diagnostic stewardship is essential when implementing a new microbiological method.

On the other hand, agricultural production is also important in terms of food sustainability. In this study, the yield and water footprint (WF) of sunflower and winter wheat in the Northwestern (Thrace) part of Turkey were modeled. In addition, the meteorological data of the optimistic (RCP 4.5) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) scenarios of three climate change models (EC-EARTH, HadGEM2-ES, and IPSL-CM5A-MR) until 2099 were obtained from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (hereafter CORDEX). According to projection data, it was predicted that the annual mean air temperature will increase between 1.7 and 3.3 °C. The average change in the precipitation will decrease between 10 and 33% during the sunflower growing seasons. It was calculated that it will increase from 9 to 25% in the winter wheat growing seasons. We calibrated grain yield using Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). Performance indicators like Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were calculated as 5.3% and 4.7% for sunflower; 7.9% and 6.3% for winter wheat, respectively. The yields and WFs of the crops were simulated according to the climate projections with the calibrated DSSAT. The yield and WF simulation results were evaluated for three successive periods (P1: 2020–2040; P2: 2041–2070; P3: 2071–2099).

Emerging contaminants from different industries have posed a significant hazard to the environment and public health. Given current bioremediation strategies, it is often a failure or inadequate for sustainable mitigation of hazardous pollutants. However, clear-cut vital information about biodegradation is quite incomplete from a conventional remediation techniques perspective. Lacking complete information on bio-transformed compounds leads to seeking alternative methods. Only scarce information about the transformed products and toxicity profile is available in the published literature. To fulfill this literature gap, various computational or in-silico technologies have emerged as alternating techniques, which are being recognized as in-silico approaches for bioremediation. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and biodegradation pathways predictions are the vital part of predictive biodegradation, including the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR), Quantitative structure-biodegradation relationship (QSBR) model system. Furthermore, machine learning (ML), artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA) based programs offer simultaneous biodegradation prediction along with toxicity and environmental fate prediction. Herein, we spotlight the feasibility of in-silico remediation approaches for various persistent, recalcitrant contaminants while traditional bioremediation fails to mitigate such pollutants. Such could be addressed by exploiting described model systems and algorithm-based programs. Furthermore, recent advances in QSAR modeling, algorithm, and dedicated biodegradation prediction system have been summarized with unique attributes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Degradation pathway prediction; Docking; In-silico bioremediation; In-silico toxicology; Molecular dynamics simulation","Biohazards; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Computational chemistry; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Molecular dynamics; Neural networks; Public health; Sustainable development; Toxicity; Alternating technique; Biodegradation pathways; Computational framework; Environmental pollutants; Molecular dynamics simulations; Quantitative structure-activity relationships; Quantitative structures; Recalcitrant compounds; Biodegradation; biodegradation; bioremediation; cleanup; computer simulation; future prospect; persistent organic pollutant; sustainability; technological development; toxicity; artificial neural network; bioremediation; computer model; environmental impact; feasibility study; genetic algorithm; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; pollutant; prediction; quantitative structure activity relation; review; social medicine; toxicology; bioremediation; computer simulation; Biodegradation, Environmental; Computer Simulation; Environmental Pollutants; Molecular Docking Simulation; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100277825

The study analysed carbon (C) stock patterns and examined the importance of environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). We conducted a synthesis of 100 studies reporting biomass carbon stock and 67 studies on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock from four land-uses: forests, plantation, agroforest, and herbaceous ecosystem from the IHR. Machine learning techniques were used to examine the importance of various environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils. Despite large variations in biomass C and SOC stock (mean ± SD) within the land-uses, natural forests have the highest biomass C stock (138.5 ± 87.3 Mg C ha−1), and plantation forests exhibited the highest SOC stock (168.8 ± 74.4 Mg C ha−1) in the top 1-m of soils. The relationship between the environmental variables (altitude, latitude, precipitation, and temperature) and carbon stock was not significantly correlated. The prediction of biomass carbon and SOC stock using different machine learning techniques (Adaboost, Bagging, Random Forest, and XGBoost) shows that the XGBoost model can predict the carbon stock for the IHR closely. Our study confirms that the carbon stock in the IHR vary on a large scale due to a diverse range of land-use and ecosystems within the region. Therefore, predicting the driver of carbon stock on a single environmental variable is impossible for the entire IHR. The IHR possesses a prominent carbon sink and biodiversity pool. Therefore, its protection is essential in fulfilling India's commitment to nationally determined contributions (NDC). Our data synthesis may also provide a baseline for the precise estimation of carbon stock, which will be vital for India's National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agroforest; Climate change; Forest; Himalayas; Plantation; XGBoost","Adaptive boosting; Biodiversity; Biomass; Climate change; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Land use; Machine learning; Magnesium; Soils; Biomass and soils; Climate change mitigation; Environmental variables; Machine learning techniques; National mission; Plantation forests; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Organic carbon; carbon; organic carbon; agroforestry; climate change; climate effect; machine learning; plantation; soil organic matter; altitude; biodiversity; biomass production; carbon sink; data synthesis; environmental factor; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; environmental temperature; forest; India; land use; machine learning; plantation; precipitation; priority journal; Review; India",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100045254

Thus, remote sensing is no longer far away. With the rapid development of aerospace and aviation remote sensing technology, a new era of three-dimensional, multi-level, multi-angle, omni-directional, and all-weather earth observation has arrived. How to activate the value of data and better serve industry applications so as to meet the rapidly growing demand for remote sensing applications has become an urgent issue for remote sensing companies. As a bridge between remote sensing data and industry applications, remote sensing image processing software plays an irreplaceable role in the process of remote sensing industrialization. With the implementation of major strategic projects such as ""China's High-Resolution Earth Observation System"" (high-score special project) and ""National Medium-term to Long-term Civilian Space Infrastructure Development Plan (2015-2025)"", domestic high-score remote sensing data is becoming more abundant. Whether these valuable data can play its value and how much value it can play depends on the conversion process from high-scoring remote sensing data to effective information and application services. The value of remote sensing data requires excellent remote sensing image processing software for mining and analysis. At the same time, vigorously developing independent and controllable remote sensing image processing software has increasingly become an urgent requirement to ensure national information security, implement the strategy of aerospace power, enhance technological innovation, and serve social development. Through the research and analysis of the development process of remote sensing satellite data and remote sensing software in China and abroad, the domestic remote sensing software has experienced three stages of development: the budding period, the catch-up period, and the independent innovation period. The remote sensing image processing software pixel information expert (PIE) is taken as an example to illustrate the development progress, typical applications, and future technological development directions of domestic remote sensing software. PIE, a domestically made remote sensing image processing software, was independently developed by PIESAT Information Technology Co., Ltd. (http: //www.piesat.cn/). While opening the application of cloud service platform, PIE has evolved from a single general-purpose software plug-in architecture to 3S integration, multi-platform, and multi-load cluster processing; from pure satellite remote sensing image processing to aerospace integrated platform; and from optical load to application mode of optics, radar, and hyperspectral full spectrum. PIE6.0 has developed from a general remote sensing image processing software to PIE-Basic remote sensing image processing software, PIE-Ortho satellite image surveying and mapping processing software, PIE-SAR radar image data processing software, PIE-Hyp hyperspectral image data processing software, PIE-UAV unmanned aerial vehicle image data processing software, PIE-SIAS scale set image analysis software, PIE-AI remote sensing image intelligent processing software, PIE-Map geographic information system software, and many other ""families"". PIE6.0 has five core capabilities: comprehensive support for multi-source remote sensing loads, intelligent extraction of full-spectrum element information, deep integration of multi-industry and full-business chains, rapid processing of massive remote sensing data, and complete control of independent property rights programs. In order to meet the ever-increasing demand for remote sensing applications, we should build an intelligent, high-performance, and practical remote sensing image processing system; provide a wider, more refined, and more in-depth special service; and gradually develop and improve market mechanisms to establish sustainable development of remote sensing industry capabilities. Domestic remote sensing software continues to develop key technologies, such as remote sensing spatiotemporal big data storage management, intelligent synthesis, incremental cascading update, cleaning analysis and mining, and information security, to improve remote sensing data analysis and processing and knowledge mining and decision support capabilities and to build shared data and codes. The open platform of methods promotes multi-source heterogeneous data sharing and interoperability. In the future, domestic remote sensing software will closely follow industry applications and public needs, advanced technology integration and collaboration, remote sensing on-orbit intelligent real-time processing, and one-stop refined remote sensing cloud services. PIE will continue to increase the contribution rate of science and technology; promote the modernization of remote sensing application capabilities; strengthen the cross-integration of remote sensing applications with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies; continue to improve remote sensing data analysis and processing, knowledge discovery, and decision support capabilities; and realize the on-demand acquisition of remote sensing data, the rapid transmission of data, and the focused services of thematic information, so that multi-source remote sensing data can truly become a powerful weapon to promote resource investigation, environmental monitoring, emergency rescue, and so on. © 2021, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

However, the joint effect of factors influencing ESV is ignored, which is an important way for influencing factors to work in the complex and frequently interacting ecosystem. In this study, we used remote sensing data, grid statistics data, and machine learning methods to reveal the spatiotemporal variation of ESV and to explore the combined effects of influencing factors in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2000 to 2015. The specific results were as follows. (1) The total ESV in the GBA decreased by 13.11 billion yuan with the rate of decline slowing over the study period, and the regulating service suffered the most damage. (2) The spatial distribution of ESV has an outer high and inner low circle structure. Compared with that of the west bank of the Pearl River estuary, ESV of the east bank is relatively lower. (3) The three kinds of combination of factors had different impacts on ecosystem services. ①The effect of land-use integrity on ecosystem services is opposite between natural ecosystem and urban ecosystem. ②When regional population density is under a certain threshold (669 people/km2), social economies and ecosystems may develop together. ③The mismatched hydrothermal conditions can lead to a decrease in ESV. The findings of our study are conducive to identifying the current situation of ecosystem services and promoting the ecological civilization construction in the GBA, and bring a new insight and perspective on the influencing mechanisms of ESV. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Influencing factors; Joint impacts; Machine learning; The guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater bay area","Barium compounds; Economics; Ecosystems; Land use; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Bay areas; Ecosystem service values; Ecosystem services; Fast developing regions; Human activities; Influencing factor; Influencing mechanisms; Joint impact; Machine-learning; The guangdong-hong kong-macao great bay area; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102560920

However, the uncertainty of NV remains a challenging issue for appropriate utilization strategies of NV. For the successful implementation of NV systems in buildings, it is essential to clarify when and how to use NV systems in advance. In order to achieve the objectives, this study investigated the predictive models of NV rate (NVR) through eight machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are suitable for the interpretation of non-linear relationships between the measured indoor and outdoor environmental variables. Among all of the algorithms, deep neural network (DNN) ensured the best prediction performance for the NVR and it was shown that 40%, 46%, and 38% better predictive performance in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) than multivariate linear regression (MLR), which had the highest error rate, respectively. Based on the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), the most influential features that affected to results of predictive models were examined and most of the ML approaches, except for MLR, had similar features (the pressure difference, outdoor temperature, wind speed, indoor relative humidity, solar radiation, the difference of indoor/outdoor relative humidity, and wind direction). The results of this study can improve the prediction performance for NVR, and this would contribute to the development of an intelligent NV system.

PM2.5 and NO2 are the most significant pollutant agents responsible for facilitating COVID-19 attributed death rates. Besides, we found only six out of many tested causal inferences to be significant and true within the AUPRC analysis. In line with the causal findings, a unidirectional causal effect is found from PM2.5 to Deaths, NO2 to Deaths, and economic growth to both PM2.5 and NO2. Corroborating the first experiment, the causal results confirmed the capability of polluting variables (PM2.5 to Deaths, NO2 to Deaths) to accelerate COVID-19 deaths. In contrast, we found evidence that unsustainable economic growth predicts the dynamics of air pollutants.

Recovery strategies such as remanufacturing enable durable parts and cores to be restored to their original functionality and performance, thereby minimising the consumption of virgin materials and energy required for the production of new parts and components. To date, the repair and restoration processes concerning those parts and cores that can be remanufactured involved conventional methods such as material overlay and welding. These conventional methods are highly dependent on skilled manual labour or specialised industrial robots. With the notable growth in the global remanufacturing industry, it is imperative to deploy highly-efficient and sustainable methods to automate repair and restoration. Recent trends in remanufacturing repair and restoration indicate an increasing interest in metal additive manufacturing technology. To enhance the additive manufacturing efficiency for automated repair and restoration, it is crucial to optimise the core design. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative outline of remanufacturing repair and restoration, using both conventional and automated methods. This paper also presents and discusses comprehensive insight into the application of AI-based techniques for design optimisation specific to additive manufacturing repair. Component design optimisation is crucial due to its impact on process efficiency and the life cycle of components. The review indicates that, despite the increasing interest in using additive manufacturing for repair and restoration, reports on the application of AI for design optimisation specific to repair and restoration using additive manufacturing remain limited. Furthermore, there are no established guidelines concerning design for repair and restoration using additive manufacturing. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research and presents a future outlook on AI-based optimisation for component design to facilitate repair and restoration using additive manufacturing. Automation is expected to facilitate the removal of roadblocks specific to process inefficiency and human limitations during conventional repair and restoration in remanufacturing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Artificial intelligence; Design optimisation; Remanufacturing; Repair and restoration","Additives; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Industrial research; Industrial robots; Life cycle; Restoration; Sustainable development; Applications of AI; Circular economy; Component design; Conventional methods; Current status; Design optimization; Durable products; Environmental sustainability; Remanufacturing; Repair and restoration; 3D printers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102116211

In this work, a novel reduction-sulfurization process using a fluidized bed reactor was investigated for treating lead sulfate containing residue. The effects of temperature, hydrogen ratio, reaction time and gas flow rate on the conversion of PbSO4 and selectivity of PbS were studied. The results showed that reducing the reaction temperature and hydrogen ratio improved the PbS selectivity, while increasing the reaction time and gas flow rate had no significant effect. In the optimal process conditions, i.e., the reaction temperature 650 °C, hydrogen ratio 20%, reaction time 5 min, and gas flow rate 550 mL min−1, the conversion and sulfurization ratios of PbSO4 were 96.2% and 84.8%, which were 2.0% and 40.1% higher than those obtained in a fixed bed reactor, suggesting that enhanced mass transfer in the fluidized bed reactor benefited the phase transformation of PbSO4 to PbS.

Semantic communication goes beyond the common Shannon paradigm of guaranteeing the correct reception of each single transmitted bit, irrespective of the meaning conveyed by the transmitted bits. The idea is that, whenever communication occurs to convey meaning or to accomplish a goal, what really matters is the impact that the received bits have on the interpretation of the meaning intended by the transmitter or on the accomplishment of a common goal. Focusing on semantic and goal-oriented aspects, and possibly combining them, helps to identify the relevant information, i.e. the information strictly necessary to recover the meaning intended by the transmitter or to accomplish a goal. Combining knowledge representation and reasoning tools with machine learning algorithms paves the way to build semantic learning strategies enabling current machine learning algorithms to achieve better interpretation capabilities and contrast adversarial attacks. 6G semantic networks can bring semantic learning mechanisms at the edge of the network and, at the same time, semantic learning can help 6G networks to improve their efficiency and sustainability. © 2021","6G; Beyond 5G; Goal oriented communications; Green communications; MEC; Semantic communications; Semantic learning; Sustainability","5G mobile communication systems; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Semantic Web; Semantics; 6g; Beyond 5g; Goal-oriented; Goal-oriented communication; Green communications; Machine learning algorithms; MEC; Semantic communication; Semantic learning; Shannon; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102257856

The functional and biological abilities of mannoproteins are influenced by their constituent components. Currently, has been found research that mannan and protein, which are components of mannoproteins, have potential as antioxidants. Based on a literature review, mannoproteins have potential as antioxidants because many hydroxyl groups are found in the chain of bonds. All mannan fractions have superior scavenging activity against hydroxyl groups at a concentration of 3.2 mg / mL while to produce scavenging activity against oxidative superoxide groups requires 3.3 mg / mL.

Electricity is a day-to-day component, which is utilized for lighting, running appliances, machines. Moreover a large number of people are now switching to electric cars. Henceforth, it is equally important to achieve self-sustainability in energy needs and also it is necessary to have an infinite energy source. Sustainable power is the solitary solution to resolve this issue. On the other hand, the Indian government is promoting solar technology a lot in the year 2021 by providing subsidies to a maximum limit of 65% for the installation of home solar projects and this encourages people to switch to electric vehicles to reduce the pollution. This article presents a machine learning based dual-axis solar tracker to enhance the energy harnessing efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed method utilizes Naïve Bayes algorithm to develop a better solution for producing higher energy from the solar panel. The Naïve Bayes algorithm is a type of machine learning algorithm, which has been used to predict the reliable direction. This proposed method generates higher electricity, when compared with the traditional method. The experimental results aim to fix the north east direction of solar panel that produces 17.4 watts per hour, wherein the proposed method produces 24.8 watts.

In addition, the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) solutions, and especially those related to Artificial Intelligence (i.e., Just Walk Out, Intelligent Retail Lab) and digitization, are particularly relevant factors in the current pandemic scenario in which retail companies operate. These tools are essential to face the derived changes in commercial relations, especially between companies and consumers. For all these reasons, this work aims to examine the effect of ICT, as a driving factor for innovation and its direct and indirect impact on sustainability in retailing. Furthermore, this study takes into account the eventual differences in these relationships according to the types of store formats. To achieve the aforementioned objective, a theoretical model is proposed that is tested through an empirical study carried out on a sample of 510 consumers of three store formats of grocery retail formats (i.e., hypermarkets, supermarkets and discount stores) in Spain. For the analysis of the data obtained, the partial least squares (PLS) regression technique and the Multigroup Analysis were used. The results obtained confirm the direct and indirect effect of ICT on innovation and sustainability in grocery retailing. In addition, the results indicate that consumers unequally perceive the technological progress of companies. These differences are greater between discount stores versus hypermarkets and supermarkets. The larger the size of the store format, the higher the incidence of ICT in relation to innovation. Therefore, it is vital to take ICT into consideration, where Artificial Intelligence is imperative for the growth and development of sustainable competitive advantages in retail companies. © Copyright © 2021 Marín-García, Gil-Saura, Ruiz-Molina and Berenguer-Contrí.","Artificial Intelligence; ICT; innovation; retailing; sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106154978

Pomace from chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa Michx.), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), and elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) represent good sources of coloring foodstuffs. Pomace powders (PP) were prepared by milling the seedless fractions of the three dried berry pomaces (50◦C, 8 h). Techno-functional properties of the powders such as particle size distribution, bulk density, sedimentation velocity, and swelling capacity were determined to evaluate the powders for possible food applications. Total anthocyanin content was quantified by UHPLC-DAD before and during a storage experiment to monitor the degradation of anthocyanins in the PP and in a yogurt model application. The high content of phenolic compounds and the still intact cell structure ensured high stability of anthocyanins over 28 days of storage. In the model application, color saturation was stable over the whole storage time of 14 days. Regarding the techno-functional properties, only a few differences between the three PP were observed. The particle size of elderberry PP was larger, resulting in lowest bulk density (0.45 g/mL), high cold-water solubility (16.42%), and a swelling capacity of 10.16 mL/g dw. Sedimentation velocity of the three PP was fast (0.02 mL/min) due to cluster formation of the particles caused by electrostatic and hydrophobic properties. Compared to other high-intensity coloring foodstuffs, the use of PP, showing acceptable color stability with potential health-promoting effects, represents a wide applicability in different food applications and especially in products with a longer shelf-life. © 2021 by the authors.

The wetland is threat-ened by human activities (deforestation, hunting, tourism, and urbanization), leading to habitat destruction, eutrophication, and sediment accumulation. To stop the degradation and to set up effective protection and restoration in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, scientific insights must be integrated into a practical framework for evidence-based support for policymakers and managers of the Anzali wetland. In this study, the Drivers–Pressure–State–Impact–Response (DPSIR) framework is used as a suitable tool to link human pressures and state changes to derive an overview of the potential impacts. Population growth, intensive agriculture, increased urbanization, and industrialization are the major driving forces that have led to a complex cascade of state changes. For instance, during recent years, water quality deterioration, habitat degradation, and the overgrowth of invasive species in the Anzali wetland watershed have caused negative socio-economic and human health impacts. Integrated and innovative monitoring programs combined with socio-environmental modeling techniques are needed for a more evidence-based management approach as part of a multiresponse strategy for the sustainable development of the wetland system. In this respect, there is a critical gap in useful information concerning biological composition and innovative monitoring methods. Moreover, the relation of biota with human activity and environmental conditions needs to be better quantified. Therefore, ecological modeling techniques based on machine learning and statistics were reviewed for their advantages and disadvantages.

Obtaining more details about LUCC is crucial for sustainable development, land conservation, and environment management. The Hola Basin (957 km2) in the northernmost part of Northeast China, a boreal forest landscape underlain by discontinuous, sporadic, and isolated permafrost, was selected for the case study. The LUCC was analyzed using the Landsat archive of satellite images from 1973 to 2019. A thematic change detection analysis was performed by combining the object-based image analysis (OBIA) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Four types of LUCC (forest, grass, water, and anthropic) were extracted with an overall accuracy of 80% for 1973 and &gt;90% for 1986, 2000, and 2019. Forest, the dominant class (750 km2 in 1973), declined by 88 km2 (11.8%) from 1973 to 1986 but had a recovery of 78 km2 (12.5%) from 2000 to 2019. Grass, the second-largest class (187 km2 in 1973), increased by 86 km2 (46.5%) between 1973 and 1986 and decreased by 90 km2 (40%) between 2000 and 2019. The anthropic class continuously increased from 10 km2 (1973) to 37 km2 (2019). Major features in LUCC are attributed to rapid population growth, resource exploitation, agriculture intensification, economic development, and frequent forest fires. Under a pronounced climate warming, these drivers have been accelerating the degradation of permafrost, subsequently triggering natural hazards and deteriorating the ecological environment. This study represents a benchmark for sustainable LUCC management in the Hola Basin, Northeast China. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to investigate the association between the built environment and QoL by using survey data collected from cancer patients within the United States in 2019. To better understand the associations, we controlled the effects from sociodemographic attributes and health-related factors along with the residential built environment, including density, diversity, design, and distance to transit and hospitals on the self-reported QoL in cancer patients after treatment. Furthermore, machine learning models, i.e., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron neural network, were employed to evaluate the contribution of these features in predicting the QoL. The results from machine learning models indicated that the travel distance to the closest large hospital, perceived accessibility, distance to transit, and population density were among the most significant predictors of the cancer patients’ QoL. Additionally, the health insurance status, age, and education of patients are associated with QoL. The adverse effects of density on the self-reported QoL in this study can be addressed by individuals’ emotions towards negative aspects of density. Given the strong association between QoL and urban sustainability, consideration should be given to the side effects of urban density on cancer patients’ perceived wellbeing. © 2021 by the authors.

Two input combination models, MLP-4-5-4 and MLP-4-9-4, were trained, verified, and tested for their predictive performance ability, and their physicochemical prediction accuracy was compared by using each model’s observed data with the predicted data. The MLP-4-5-4 model showed a better understanding of the data sets and water quality predictive ability giving an MSE of 39.06589 and a correlation coefficient (R2) of the observed and the predicted water quality of 0.989383 compared to the MLP-4-9-4 model (R2 = 0.993532, MSE = 39.03087). These results apply to natural water resources management in South Africa and similar catchment systems.

Accurate measurement of their occurrence and extent is required to facilitate sustainable management. A key challenge, however, is the high cloud cover in the tropics that limits optical remote sensing data acquisition. In this work we combine optical imagery with radar and elevation data to optimise land cover classification for the Greater Amanzule tropical peatland. Sentinel‐2, Sentinel‐1 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) imagery were acquired and integrated to drive a machine learning land cover classification using a random forest classifier. Recursive feature elimination was used to op-timize high‐dimensional and correlated feature space and determine the optimal features for the classification. Six datasets were compared, comprising different combinations of optical, radar and elevation features. Results showed that the best overall accuracy (OA) was found for the integrated Sentinel‐2, Sentinel‐1 and SRTM dataset (S2+S1+DEM), significantly outperforming all the other classifications with an OA of 94%. Assessment of the sensitivity of land cover classes to image features indicated that elevation and the original Sentinel‐1 bands contributed the most to separating tropical peatlands from other land cover types. The integration of more features and the removal of redundant features systematically increased classification accuracy. We estimate Ghana’s Greater Amanzule peatland covers 60,187 ha. Our proposed methodological framework contributes a robust workflow for accurate and detailed landscape‐scale monitoring of tropical peatlands, while our findings provide timely information critical for the sustainable management of the Greater Amanzule peatland. © 2021 by the authors.

This study is based on the geoscientific theory that emphasizes the connections between geodynamic background, metallogenic process and quantitative assessment. Taking the Luanchuan mining district as an example, using geoscience big data (multi-dimensional, multi-scale geological, geophysical, geochemical, multi-temporal hyperspectral/high-resolution remote sensing, real-time mining data) platform, including deep artificial intelligence mining technology as well as 3D/4D multi-disciplinary, multi-parameter, multi-scale modeling technology, we constructed a 3D geological model, a metallogenic process model and a quantitative exploration model at the district and deposit scales, and performed quantitative prediction and assessment of the related mineral resources. The aim was to achieve dynamic assessment of high-precision 3D geo-environmental (rock, structure, hydrology, soil, etc.) protection and comprehensive development and utilization of resources in digital mines, so as to provide a scientific basis for the sustainable mineral resource development in the study area. The research results are summarized in three main aspects: (1) Application of geoscience big data in resource prediction and assessment of district. By mining geoscience big data such as 3D geological modeling, geological and geophysical forward/backward interpretation, geochemical and remote sensing data mining, etc., with use of the self-developed GeoCube2.0 software, deep target optimization and comprehensive mineral resources assessment were achieved for the Luanchuan mining district (500 km2 in area, 2.5 km deep). The predicted Mo, W and Pb-Zn-Ag resources in the mining district were 6.5, 1.5 and 5 million tons, respectively. (2) Three-dimensional geologic modeling of ore deposit and mineral exploration related to mining environment. Field data collected from the Nannihu-Sandaozhuang-Shangfang open pits and the Luotuoshan deep channel mining zones show that the spatial correlation between the NW-trending porphyry-skarn deposit/orebody and groundwater space is not high, and the NE-trending faults-usually tensional or tenso-torsional in the post-metallogenic period-are the pathway for groundwater migration. In the NW-trending Pb-Zn deposit, there are significant secondary metalloid leaching, where shallow Pb-Zn oxides and Mn-Fe minerals are associated with malachite and bloom from water erosion. There is a risk of groundwater pollution in the high-altitude Pb-Zn mining zone as well as in the Lengshui and Bailugou deposits, where NE-trending faults are developed outside of the porphyry-skarn Mo(W) deposits in the study area. (3) Geoscience model construction in intelligent digital mines for resource-environmental joint assessment and planning. A 3D geological model, with relevance to ancient mining caves, open pits, and deep laneways in the mining area, was established for large mines to provide guidance for the mining industry toward sustainable resource development. Using hyperspectral database, 3D models for both useful and harmful mineral elements were constructed to unite the mineral exploration, mining and processing processes in facilitating the recovery of harmful elements (As, Sb, Hg, etc.).

However, previous studies have focused more on the use of single data sources, such as AIS (Automatic Information System) and VBD (VIIRS boat detection), to obtain fishing intensity information and, as such, have encountered some problems, such as insufficient comprehensive data coverage for ships, non-uniform spatial distribution of data signal acquisition, and insufficient accuracy in obtaining fishing intensity information. The development of big data and remote sensing Earth observation technology has provided abundant data sources and technical support for the acquisition of fishing intensity data for marine fisheries. Based on this situation, this paper proposes a framework that integrates the data of fishing vessels from two sources (AIS, with high space-time granularity, and VBD, with short revisit cycle and high sensitivity), in order to obtain such information based on closely matching and fusing the vector point data of ship positions. With the help of this framework and the strategy of indirectly representing fishing intensity by data point density after fusion, the spatial characteristics and rules of fishing intensity in typical seasons (February, April, September, and November) in the northern South China Sea in 2018 were systematically analyzed and investigated. The results revealed the following: (1) Matching and fusing AIS and VBD data can provide a better perspective to produce robust and accurate marine fishery intensity data. The two types of data have a low proximity match rate (approximately 1.89% and 6.73% of their respective inputs) and the matching success for fishing vessels in the data was 49.42%. (2) Single AIS data can be used for nearshore (50 to 70 km) marine fishery analysis research, while VBD data reflect the objective marine fishing in space, showing obvious complementarity with AIS. (3) The fishing intensity grid data obtained from the integrated data show that high-intensity fishing in the study area was concentrated in the coastal area of Maoming City, Guangdong (0-50 km); the coastal area of Guangxi Beihai (10-70 km); around Hainan Island in Zhangzhou (10-30 km); and the Sanya nearshore area (0-50 km). However, it did not decay with increasing offshore distance, such as at the Trans-Vietnamese boundary in the Beibu Gulf, near the China-Vietnam Common Fisheries Area (50 km) and high-intensity fishing areas. (4) The obtained fishing intensity data (AIS, VBD, and AIS + VBD) were quantitatively analyzed, showing that the CV (Coefficient of Variation) of the average for each month (after fusing the two types of data) was 0.995, indicating that the distribution of the combined data was better than that before fusion (before fusion: AIS = 0.879, VBD = 1.642). Therefore, the integration of AIS and VBD can meet the need for a more effective, comprehensive, and accurate fishing intensity analysis in marine fishery resources. © 2021 by the authors.","AIS; Data fusion; Fishing intensity; Geographic data; Marine fisheries sustainable; Northern south china sea; VBD",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106702792

This strain also showed the potential to secrete a broad range of enzymes for fermentation of eight sugars that could be involved in potato waste bioconversion. The results of the fermentation assay indicated that Streptomyces sp. strain SO6 degrades potato wastes during submerged fermentation, diminishing total dry weight and increasing reducing sugars from 0.3 to 3.6 mg.mL-1 and total proteins from 70.6 to 187.7 μg.mL-1. The results showed that Streptomyces strain SO6 was able to convert the potato waste into 0.96 mg.g.1 of diffusible antifungals and 1.75 mg.g.1 of reddish-purple biopigments. On the contrary, an absence of pigment production was observed during the fermentation of the commercial medium used as reference. According to our results, replacement of commercial culture media with available low-cost agroindustrial wastes for producing bioactive chemicals is a real opportunity to enhance the Streptomyces pigment production and antibiotic sustainability with cost-competitiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the simultaneous production of biopigments and diffusible antifungal antibiotics produced by Streptomyces spp. using potato solid waste as the sole nutrient source. © 2021 Schalchli et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106359567

However, due to slow take-up of LMS many schools in developing countries, especially Africa were completely shut down due to COVID-19 pandemic. To fill this gap, 4 AI-based models; Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) were developed for prediction of LMS determinants. Nonlinear sensitivity analysis was employed to select the key parameters of the LMS determinants data obtained from 1244 schools’ students. Five statistical indices were used to validate the models. The performance results of the four developed AI models discovered facilitating conditions, attitude towards LMS, perceived enjoyment, users’ satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and ease of use to be the most significant factors that affect educational sustainability in Nigeria during COVID-19. Further, single model’s performance results comparison proved that SVM has the highest prediction ability compared to GPR, ANN, and BRT due to its robustness in handling data uncertainties.

It is responsible for personal mobility (access to services, goods, and leisure), and that is why world economies rely upon the efficient and safe functioning of transportation facilities. Road maintenance is vital since the need for maintenance increases as road infrastructure ages and is based on sustainability, meaning that spending money now saves much more in the future. Furthermore, road maintenance plays a significant role in road safety. However, pavement management is a challenging task because available budgets are limited. Road agencies need to set programming plans for the short term and the long term to select and schedule maintenance and rehabilitation operations. Pavement performance prediction models (PPPMs) are a crucial element in pavement management systems (PMSs), providing the prediction of distresses and, therefore, allowing active and efficient management. This work aims to review the modeling techniques that are commonly used in the development of these models. The pavement deterioration process is stochastic by nature. It requires complex deterministic or probabilistic modeling techniques, which will be presented here, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. Finally, conclusions will be drawn, and some guidelines to support the development of PPPMs will be proposed. © 2021 by the authors.

Solving the OPF problem reduces three essential items: operation costs, transmission losses, and voltage drops. An intelligent controller is needed to adjust the power system’s control parameters to solve this problem optimally. However, many constraints must be considered that make the design process of the OPF algorithm exceedingly tricky due to the increased number of limitations and control variables. This paper proposes a multi‐objective intelligent control technique based on three different meta‐heuristic optimization algorithms: multi‐verse optimization (MVO), grasshopper optimization (GOA), and Harris hawks optimization (HHO) to solve the OPF problem. The proposed control techniques were validated by applying them to the IEEE‐30 bus system under different operating conditions through MATLAB simulations. The proposed techniques were then compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which is very popular in the literature studying how to solving the OPF problem. The obtained results show that the proposed methods are more effective in solving the OPF problem when compared to the commonly used PSO algorithm.

Typhoon Lekima is among the top five most devastating typhoons in China and caused economic losses totaling over USD 8 billion in Zhejiang Province alone during 9–12 August 2019. However, there still is no assessment of its impacts on forests. Here we detected forest damage and its spatial distribution caused by Typhoon Lekima by classifying Landsat 8 OLI images using the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm and the univariate image differencing (UID) method on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The accuracy assessment indicated a high overall accuracy (&gt;87%) and kappa coefficient (&gt;0.75) for forest-damage detection, as evaluated against field-investigated plot data, with better performance using the RF method. The total affected forest area by Lekima was 4598.87 km2, accounting for 8.44% of the total forest area in Zhejiang Province. The light-, moderate-and severe-damage forest areas were 2106.29 km2, 2024.26 km2 and 469.76 km2, respectively. Considering the damage severity, the net forest canopy loss fraction was 2.57%. The affected forest area and damage severity exhibited large spatial variations, which were affected by elevation, slope, precipitation and forest type. Our study indicated a larger uncertainty for affected forest area and a smaller uncertainty for the proportion of damage severity, based on multiple assessment approaches. This is among the first studies on forest damage due to typhoons at a regional scale in China, and the methods can be extended to examine the impacts of other super-strong typhoons on forests. Our study results on damage severity, spatial distribution and controlling factors could help local governments, the forest sector and forest landowners make decision on tree-planting planning and sustainable management after typhoon strikes and could also raise public and governmental awareness of typhoons’ damage on China’s inland forests. © 2021 by the authors.

To effectively use center pivot irrigation systems, producers require tools to support their decision-making on when and how much water to irrigate. However, currently producers make these decisions primarily based on experience and/or limited information of weather. Ineffective use of irrigation systems can lead to overuse of water resources, compromise crop productivity, and directly reduce producers' economic return as well as bring negative impacts on environmental sustainability. In this paper, we surveyed existing precision irrigation research and tools from peer-reviewed literature, land-grant university extension and industry products, and U.S. patents. We focused on four challenge areas related to precision irrigation decision-support systems: (a) data availability and scalability, (b) quantification of plant water stress, (c) model uncertainties and constraints, and (d) producers' participation and motivation. We then identified opportunities to address the above four challenge areas: (a) increase the use of high spatial-temporal-resolution satellite fusion products and inexpensive sensor networks to scale up the adoption of precision irrigation decision-support systems; (b) use mechanistic quantification of 'plant water stress' as triggers to improve irrigation decision, by explicitly considering the interaction between soil water supply, atmospheric water demand, and plant physiological regulation; (c) constrain the process-based and statistical/machine learning models at each individual field using data-model fusion methods for scalable solutions; and (d) develop easy-to-use tools with flexibility, and increase governments' financial incentives and support. We conclude this review by laying out our vision for precision irrigation decision-support systems for center pivots that can achieve scalable, economical, reliable, and easy-to-use irrigation management for producers. © 2021 The Author(s).

Smallholder farmers play a crucial role in combating food insecurity. However, local planning agencies and governments do not have adequate spatial information on smallholder farmers, and this affects the monitoring of the SDGs. This study utilized Sentinel-1 multi-temporal data to develop a framework for mapping smallholder maize farms and to estimate maize production area as a parameter for supporting the SDGs. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to pixel fuse the multi-temporal data to only three components for each polarization (vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV), vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH), and VV/VH), which explained more than 70% of the information. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost) algorithms were used at model-level feature fusion to classify the data. The results show that the adopted strategy of two-stage image fusion was sufficient to map the distribution and estimate production areas for smallholder farms. An overall accuracy of more than 90% for both SVM and Xgboost algorithms was achieved. There was a 3% difference in production area estimation observed between the two algorithms. This framework can be used to generate spatial agricultural information in areas where agricultural survey data are limited and for areas that are affected by cloud coverage. We recommend the use of Sentinel-1 multi-temporal data in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to map smallholder maize farms to support the SDGs. © 2021 by the authors.

Recently, the deep learning models for PD detection have been used to diagnose the PD fault of facilities and cables. Most PD studies have been conducted in the field, such as gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) and power cables for high voltage transmission networks. There are few studies of PD fault detection for on-site low-voltage distribution networks. Additionally, there are few studies of PD detection algorithms for improving the accuracy of the deep learning models using small real PD data only. In this study, a PD online detection system and a model for long-term operational sustainability of on-site low voltage distribution networks are proposed using convolutional neural network (CNN) transfer-learning. The proposed PD online system makes it possible to acquire as many real PD data as possible through continuous monitoring of PD occurrence. The PD detection accuracy results showed that the proposed CNN transfer-learning models are more effective models for obtaining improved accuracy (97.4%) than benchmark models, such as CNN and support vector machine (SVM) using only small real PD data acquired from PD online detection system. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of this paper is to thoroughly analyse the simulated case studies of the four different categories (i.e., in‐house, technical expertise, commitment and common goals) of the CORE model from the perspective of the various clients. This study builds on the previous work on the outsourcing relationships between a client and a globalized FM service provider. It further ex-plores the application of this model with the aid of artificial neural networks (ANNs) towards a sustainable future. A quantitative methodology through a survey is used to analyse eight outsourcing strategies for the four outsourcing relationships. A set of revised rules of the CORE is introduced and discussed regarding the approaches to investigate the four simulated outsourcing relationship systems. The study further reveals that an interesting understanding of the four outsourcing categories can be systematically and efficiently implemented into the FM outsourcing relationships through the methodology of scientific Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is concluded that FM outsourcing categorization may help to define the appropriate relationships. This further detailed outcome generated from the ANN can be clearly considered a strong and solid reference to define and ex-plain the existing outsourcing relationships between the stakeholders and the service providers with the aim to assign an outsourcing category to the FM relationship between the client and service provider based on the learnt rules. © 2021 by the authors.

Agriculture is recognized as a key application area for digital technologies, including artificial intelligence. This is not least because it faces major sustainability challenges, especially with regard to meeting the climate and biodiversity targets set out in the Paris Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as the water-related objectives of EU environmental legislation. Based on an overview of the possible applications of digital technologies in agriculture, the article offers a status quo analysis of legal acts with relevance to digitalization in the EU agricultural sector. It is found that a reliable legal framework with regard to product liability and product safety, as well as data privacy, data access, and data security is important in this context. In addition, the European Common Agricultural Policy, as the most important funding instrument for digital innovations in the agricultural sector, should be designed in such a way that it links digitalization-related objectives more closely with sustainability targets. So far, the existing EU governance does not fully exploit the potentials of digitalization for environmental protection, and sight is lost of possible negative side effects such as rebound and shifting effects.

In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. Chapter 2: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander connection to culture: building stronger individual and collective wellbeing: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said — that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Chapter 3: Physical determinants of health: healthy, liveable and sustainable communities: Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners — to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. Chapter 4: Health promotion in the Anthropocene: the ecological determinants of health: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia’s position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches — planetary health, Indigenous people’s knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. Chapter 5: Disrupting the commercial determinants of health: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. Chapter 6: Digital determinants of health: the digital transformation: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. Chapter 7: Governance for health and equity: a vision for our future: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia’s direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing — most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights (including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an independent media. Measures to overcome the climate crisis were adopted and democratic processes introduced in the provision of housing, education and community development. © 2021 AMPCo Pty Ltd",,"Australia; commercial phenomena; environmental health; forecasting; health care planning; health equity; health promotion; human; indigenous health care; Oceanic ancestry group; social determinants of health; Australia; Commerce; Community Health Planning; Digital Technology; Environmental Health; Forecasting; Health Equity; Health Promotion; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Social Determinants of Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105030886

At the same time, rapid advancements have also been taking place in tracing, mapping, remote sensing, machine learning, and modelling technologies in hydrological research. Despite those programs and advancements, a water crisis is intensifying globally. The missing link is effective interactions between the hydrological research and water resource management to support implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at multiple spatial scales. Since the watershed is the natural unit for water resources management, watershed science offers the potential to bridge this missing link. This study first reviews the advances in hydrological research and water resources management, and then discusses issues and challenges facing the global water community. Subsequently, it describes the core components of watershed science: (1) hydrological analysis; (2) water-operation policies; (3) governance; (4) management and feedback. The framework takes into account water availability, water uses, and water quality; explicitly focuses on the storage, fluxes, and quality of the hydrological cycle; defines appropriate local water resource thresholds through incorporating the planetary boundary framework; and identifies specific actionable measures for water resources management. It provides a complementary approach to the existing water management programs in addressing the current global water crisis and achieving the UN SDGs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Hydrology; Integrated water resources management (IWRM); Water crisis; Watershed science","Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Effective interactions; Integrated Water Resources Management; Issues and challenges; Sustainable management; Temporal and spatial scale; Water management projects; Water resources management; Waterresource management; Research and development management; hydrological modeling; integrated approach; research work; river basin; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; water management; water resource; watershed",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104905187

One of the main strategies used to counter this trend is the use of new technologies. On this topic, the Internet of Things has been highlighted, with these solutions being characterized by offering robustness and simplicity, while being low cost. This paper presents the study and development of an automatic irrigation control system for agricultural fields. The developed solution had a wireless sensors and actuators network, a mobile application that offers the user the capability of consulting not only the data collected in real time but also their history and also act in accordance with the data it analyses. To adapt the water management, Machine Learning algorithms were studied to predict the best time of day for water administration. Of the studied algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Support Vectors Machines) the one that obtained the best results was Random Forest, presenting an accuracy of 84.6%. Besides the ML solution, a method was also developed to calculate the amount of water needed to manage the fields under analysis. Through the implementation of the system it was possible to realize that the developed solution is effective and can achieve up to 60% of water savings. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, the wool keratin modified magnetite (Fe3O4) powders were fabricated by using wool waste via a co-precipitation technique for removal of Cu2+ ions from aqueous solutions. The morphology, chemical composi-tions, crystal structure, microstructure, magnetism properties, organic content, and specific surface area of as-fabricated powders were systematically characterized by various techniques including field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and Brunauer–Em-mett–Teller (BET) surface area analyzer. The effects of experimental parameters such as the volume of wool keratin hydrolysate, the dosage of powder, the initial Cu2+ ion concentration, and the pH value of solution on the adsorption capacity of Cu2+ ions by the powders were examined. The experimental results indicated that the Cu2+ ion adsorption performance of the wool keratin modified Fe3O4 powders exhibited much better than that of the chitosan modified ones with a maximum Cu2+ adsorption capacity of 27.4 mg/g under favorable conditions (0.05 g powders; 50 mL of 40 mg/L CuSO4; pH 5; temperature 293 K). The high adsorption capacity towards Cu2+ ions on the wool keratin modified Fe3O4 powders was primarily because of the strong surface complexation of –COOH and –NH2 functional groups of wool keratins with Cu2+ ions. The Cu2+ ion adsorption process on the wool keratin modified Fe3O4 powders followed the Temkin adsorption isotherm model and the intraparticle diffusion and pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic models. After Cu2+ ion removal, the wool keratin modified Fe3O4 powders were easily separated using a magnet from aqueous solution and efficiently regenerated using 0.5 M ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-H2SO4 elut-ing. The wool keratin modified Fe3O4 powders possessed good regenerative performance after five cycles. This study provided a feasible way to utilize waste wool textiles for preparing magnetic biomass-based adsorbents for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions. © 2021 by the authors.

The preservation of both the built form and the intangible socio-cultural associations with them are global concern in process of urbanization, and in the notion of sustainable development. However, there is a lack of multi-dimensional and cross-cultural quantitative research in settlement morphology, making it difficult to guide practice effectively. Therefore, this study focuses on exploring an automatic or semi-automatic quantification and classification method for the morphological identity of ethnic mountain settlements. We introduce and combine 3-D morphological indicators with existing 2-D indicators to build and test three different sets of indication systems for semi-automatic classification for the settlements’ ethnic attribute basing on spatial morphology. Taking the Miao, Dong, and Tunpu (Han) ethnic settlements in Guizhou province, southwest China as research samples, we applied factor analysis and hierarchical clustering methods to compare the classification accuracy under the three systems using data from topographic map, field investigation map, satellite imageries, and ethnography or local chronicle. The results showed that, the 3-D indication system has succeeded in semi-automatic quantification and classification of settlement morphology and ethnic identity by greatly increasing the classification accuracy to 96.30%, which is a huge improvement compared with the basic 2-D indication system (42.59%) and the advanced 2-D indication system (61.11%). The settlement samples are further divided into two sub-types with significant morphological differences in each major ethnic category under the 3-D indication system. We then discussed the potential improvement and future large-scale application of this method with the help of machine learning and other smart techniques. We hope to provide a comprehensive quantitative perspective and a more scientific reference for the future preservation and sustainable development of the massive and diverse vernacular heritages across the world. © 2021, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","3-D morphology; China; Cultural identity; Ethnic mountain settlements; Quantitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104051957

Through the examination of its reproductive cycle, using histological maturity identifiers, the Lm50 of males and females were redefined at 265 mm TL/ 1.0 year age and 305 mm TL/ 1.2 year age, respectively. The size-based fecundity, sex ratio and abundance revealed that females of 281–360 mm TL/ 1.0–1.6 year of age have maximum reproductive potential. In the catch, 45%–65% of males and females were below Lm50. The temporal progression of mean length in the catch (MLC) and female length at maturity showed declining trend. Application of length-based indicators (LBI) and stock assessment models showed the fishery in near full exploitation, less optimal and undergoing multi-generation, indiscriminate, size-selective overfishing. The spawning stock biomass (SSB) has declined to 26.8% of the virgin SSB, while the yearly spawning potential ratio (SPR) ranged from 0.04 to 0.29, which is lower than the SPR threshold (0.3) suggested for sustaining a fishery. The species is both growth and recruitment overfished. Though the mean annual catch is marginally lower than the estimated maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of 32,953 t, any increase in fishing effort would further impact the SSB. Based on the results, a MLS of 360 mm TL, minimum mesh size of 110 mm for fishing gear and a precautionary annual catch limit of 30,000 t suggested for management, and the potential impact of implementing these on fishers’ catches discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bay of Bengal; Length at maturity; Length-based indicator; Spawning potential ratio; Stock assessment; Tenualosa ilisha",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103383249

In particular, business leaders are adopting a new paradigm of planning, dynamic adaptive plans, which react adaptively to uncertainties by adjusting plans according to rapid changes in circumstances. However, these dynamic plans have been applied in larger-scale industries such as wastewater management in longer-range time frames. This paper follows the dynamic adaptive plan paradigm but transfers it to the technology management context with shorter-range action plans. Based on this new paradigm of risk management and technology planning, we propose a risk-adaptive technology roadmap (TRM) that can adapt to changing complex environments. First we identify risk by topic modeling based on futuristic data and then by sentiment analysis. Second, for the derived risks, we determine new and alternative plans by co-occurrence of risk-related keywords. Third, we convert an existing TRM to network topology with adaptive plans and construct a conditional probability table for the network. Finally, we estimate posterior probability and infer it by Bayesian network by adjusting plans depending on occurrence of risk events. Based on this posterior probability, we remap the paths in the previous TRM to new maps, and we apply our proposed approach to the field of artificial intelligence to validate its feasibility. Our research contributes to the possibility of using dynamic adaptive planning with technology as well as to increase the sustainability of technology roadmapping. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Adaptation pathways; Bayesian network; Risk and uncertainty; Technology roadmap; Topic modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103179576

OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes farmers' decision-making in the CBWM program, and mutual learning and collective decisions among local actors in Boset District - Ethiopia. METHODS: Role-Playing Game (RPG) was the main method of the study. In order to collect pertinent information during the game sessions, observation of farmers' behavior and group discussions were used. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis were employed to analyze game outputs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results show that farmers prefer to collectively work on private farmlands rather than on communal land. Furthermore, participation of farmers in campaign works was higher under a default-scenario (with control instruments), than under a willingness-scenario (without control instruments). In making decisions on their level of participation in campaign works, farmers followed the decisions of a fellow farmer they considered more knowledgeable. However, the participation of farmers in the maintenance of Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) structures was more or less the same under both scenarios. Both farmers' level of participation in campaign works and maintenance decisions were influenced by their proximity to the CBWM intervention areas (i.e. micro-watersheds) as well as their awareness and motivation. The commitment of local government actors was also crucial to enforce and encourage the farmers to participate in the program. Based on farmers' decisions in the RPG, none of the two scenarios simultaneously enhance the total land area covered with SWC structures and income of farmers. An important benefit of this game was that it stimulated mutual learning and collective decisions on micro-watersheds to be treated and alternative management strategies for the CBWM program. This revealed that there is a need to (1) motivate farmers through capacity building, (2) enhance the commitment of local government actors, and (3) introduce participatory planning to enhance mutual learning and collective decisions for sustainable watershed management. SIGNIFICANCE: While directly applicable to the study area, these recommendations and the RPG (as a toolkit) are essential to enhance the outcomes and sustainability of collective watershed management initiatives in other parts of the world. © 2021","Ethiopia; Farmers; Intervention strategies; Role-playing games; Watershed management","adaptive management; agricultural land; basin management; capacity building; collective action; decision making; machine learning; maintenance; management practice; participatory approach; qualitative analysis; soil and water assessment tool; sustainability; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102895407

This tree species is known as a source of income for local people via preparing medicine, food, industrial oil, livestock feed, and an effective role in water and soil conservation. In recent years, the reduction of M. peregrina has damaged ecosystem services in south-eastern Iran. According, the main objective of this study is to use new Machine Learning (ML) models include: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to predict the regions susceptible to M. peregrine recovery. South Baluchistan in Iran was selected as a study area due to its location in a represent amen region where sustainable environmental production is threatened by land degradation processes. The location of 83-plant mass of M. peregrina was recorded in field visits by a global positioning system (GPS) device to recognize the relationship between them and thirteen meteorological, morphometric, and geological indicators. Within the 83 selected sites, 70% of them were used for training and 30% used for ML models calibration to predict the susceptible growth regions of M. peregrina to determine the most important indicators affecting his presence and to determine the prediction accuracy for ML models, the Jackknife test method and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were used, respectively. The results showed that rainfall was the key indicator that determines the success of the plant establishment. So that, it had the most value of the percentage of relative decrease (PRD) as the following was 20.68, 30, 24.52, and 14 for the SVM, MDA, RF, and CART models, respectively. Models validation showed that the RF model with an AUC value of 0.882, is an efficient and reliable model to predict the regions susceptible to growth M. peregrina. It followed by the CART (0.849), MDA (0.832), and SVM (0.827). The final map of the RF method demonstrated that the area with a higher probability for growing M. peregrina is the wettest one. The results of this investigation are the potential map of M. peregrina growth that will contribute to the restoration of the land and will increase primary production, water, and soil protection, increase local people's income and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Classification and regression trees; Moringa peregrina; Multivariate discriminant analysis; Random forest; SDGs; Support vector machine","angiosperm; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; environmental restoration; GPS; growth; machine learning; model validation; prediction; restoration ecology; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Iran; Indicator indicator; Moringa peregrina; Peregrina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102751314

The limiting similarity hypothesis assumes that exceeding a threshold of interspecific similarity leads to competitive exclusion. The hypothesis of limiting dissimilarity states the opposite - a condition of implementing competitive exclusion is exceeding of a threshold of interspecific dissimilarity. These hypotheses clearly contradict each other and we tested them on the model of competition at different values of relative competitiveness of the species. The model of competition under study we implemented as automatic deductive inference by a method of a completely transparent and completely explainable artificial intelligence. In order to strictly verify the hypotheses, we have excluded different possible factors promoting competitive coexistence. We have achieved that by ensuring that all conditions for the studied complete competitors were equal, with the exception of competitiveness of the species. Using our individual-based cellular automata model we demonstrate that two trophically identical species aggressively competing for a single limiting resource, all other things being equal, may coexist in one limited habitat until the threshold of differences in competitiveness exceeds 31%. The obtained results reject the hypothesis of limiting similarity and confirm the hypothesis about the limiting dissimilarity. The results are of importance for evolution theory and for finding pathways to ecological sustainability.

LCA determines the overall impact on the environment by defining, calculation and analyzing all the input and output directly related to production, utilization, and disposal of a product or a process. In this work, a LCA (cradle to grave) of bottles for drinking water was developed on three scenarios: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, as conventional packaging material for outdoor drinking water, polylactic acid (PLA) bottles, as alternative and innovative biodegradable packaging and aluminum bottle, as reusable and almost infinitely refilling packaging. As a result of LCA, ten impacts categories have been accounted for, among which the global warming potential (GWP, measured as kgCO2 eq), the eutrophication potential (EP, measured as kgPO4 eq.), human and eco-toxicity (HTP and ETP, measured as kg 1,4-DB eq.). The average drinking water consumption in Italy has been estimated in 1.5 L per day, corresponding to three 500 ml-plastic bottles and 1 refillable aluminum bottle. LCA has been firstly applied to a single bottle production and use, then to the daily and annual bottles consumption. PET bottles production and use assure the lower environmental impacts compared to PLA bottles, burdened by agricultural phase for corn cultivation, and to aluminum bottles, when the every-day washing with hot water or water and soap is comprehended. Moreover, including the end-of-life options into the analysis, PET recycling permits to reduce up to about 30% the GWP, whereas PLA composting does not lead to any GWP savings. In this study, aluminum bottle has been considered reusable for 2.5 years. The microbiological quality of water in one-way PET and PLA bottles has been compared with the refillable bottle rinsing with hot water and soap and only hot water, highlighting that the level of contamination is alarmingly increased in the latter case. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Aluminum refillable bottle; LCA; PET bottle; PLA bottle; Sustainability; Water quality","drinking water; hot water; polyethylene terephthalate; polylactic acid; soap; water; aluminum; plastic; polyester; polylactide; aluminum; drinking water; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; plastic waste; Article; composting; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; maize; packaging; priority journal; recycling; statistical analysis; tillage; water quality; human; Italy; Italy; Trachinotus falcatus; Aluminum; Drinking Water; Humans; Italy; Plastics; Polyesters; Polyethylene Terephthalates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102589718

Although 3-ketosteroid Δ1-dehydrogenase (KsdD) catalyzes this reaction with high efficiency and selectivity, the low stability and high cost of the purified enzyme catalyst have limited its industrial application. In this study, an epoxy support was used to evaluate the covalent immobilization of KsdD from Pimelobacter simplex, and the best androsta-1,4-diene-317-dione (ADD) production was achieved after optimized immobilization of KsdD enzyme in 1.5 M NaH2PO4- Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 6.5) for 12 h at 25 °C. The immobilized KsdD exhibited higher tolerance toward 20 % methanol. The dehydrogenation reaction reached a conversion efficiency of up to 90.0 % in 2 h when using 0.6 mg/mL of 4-androstene-317-dione (AD). The W299A and W299 G mutants of KsdD were also immobilized, and both showed the better catalytic performance with higher kcat/KM values compared with the wild type (WT). The immobilized W299A, W299 G and WT KsdD respectively maintained 70.5, 65.7 and 38.7 % of their initial activity at the end of 15 reaction cycles. Furthermore, the W299A retained 66.3 % of the initial activity after 30 days of incubation at 4 °C, and was more stable than free KsdD, Thus, the immobilized W299A is a promising biocatalyst for steroid dehydrogenation. In this study, we investigated the application of immobilized enzymes for the dehydrogenation of steroids, which will be of great importance for improving the development of green technology and sustainable use of biocatalysts in the steroid manufacturing industry. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","3-ketosteroid Δ1-dehydrogenase; Biocatalysis; Dehydrogenation; Immobilization; Pimelobacter simplex; Steroid","Catalyst selectivity; Dehydrogenation; Efficiency; Enzyme immobilization; Green manufacturing; Lipids; Phosphorus compounds; Sodium compounds; Substrates; Catalytic performance; Covalent immobilization; Dehydrogenation reactions; Green technology; Immobilized enzyme; Initial activity; Manufacturing industries; Sustainable use; Biocatalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102571601

The prevention of prenatal alcohol exposure is thus a public health priority – and one that should account for the particular needs of subpopulations, including in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities. Prior to conception, alcohol-exposed pregnancy prevention is accomplished by encouraging the reduction or elimination of risky alcohol use and/or promoting effective contraceptive use among risky drinkers who could become pregnant. The current study builds on promising findings about the impact of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CHOICES intervention with AI/AN communities by implementing a randomized control trial of Native CHOICES, a cultural adaptation of CHOICES, with AI/AN women in a rural reservation community. Methods: AI/AN women aged 18–44 who are at-risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy are being recruited. Participants are randomized in 1:1 proportion to the intervention and a services-as-usual, waitlist control condition. The Native CHOICES intervention consists of 2 motivational interviewing (MI) sessions, an elective contraception counseling session, and electronic messaging to boost the effects of MI. Data are collected at baseline and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-baseline. Those assigned to the control group are eligible to enroll in Native CHOICES following the completion of the 6 months post-baseline data collection. In addition to testing intervention effectiveness, the study is designed to yield a comprehensive economic evaluation, which will provide important information regarding the financial feasibility and sustainability of Native CHOICES for healthcare systems serving AI/ANs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Alcohol; Alcohol-exposed pregnancy; American Indian tribes; CHOICES intervention; Contraception; Prevention of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders","alcohol; hormonal contraceptive agent; adult; alcohol consumption; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; American Indian; Article; clinical article; contraception; contraceptive behavior; controlled study; counseling; e-mail; economic evaluation; female; fetal alcohol syndrome; follow up; health care system; human; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; motivational interviewing; pregnancy; risk reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102339463
